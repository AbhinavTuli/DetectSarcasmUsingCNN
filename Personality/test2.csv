"okay. this is weird. i don't like assignments like this one. i'm trying to track my own thoughts and feelings; trying to be somewhat original and all i find is nothing really. seems like deep down i am pretty reserved. well, actually i know that i am so this is not a surprising. anyways, there it is . nothing. rachel just got home. she is my sister. she had swim team practice. i think she has more talent than she is willing to admit she has. does that make sense? working hard isn't her most favorite thing, though. i bet you wondering why i am expressing myself so badly. it has to do with the fact that english is not my native language. i am german. my real family is still in germany. so rachel is not my real sister. she is part of the family i am staying with. now i am going blank again. let's talk about the family i am staying with then. they are very kind. after all, they aren't charging me anything. why? that's a longer story. i think my host mom would be an interesting case for psychology. there isn't anything wrong with her. it's just an perfect example for insecurity at its highest level. the funny thing is that nobody would ever suspect this insecurity. and i am sure she would vehemently repudiate such a statement. but it's true. from what i understand you can blame that on her childhood. her version is that her parents wanted a boy as their first child. well, it was her they got. accordingly, her parents made that very clear throughout her whole life. well, you can derive your own implications. anyways, she is on a constant mission to prove to everybody how smart and special she is. it goes even so far that she fabricates facts in order to win arguments. even when you present her with indisputable facts she refuses to admit that she was wrong. she goes as far as questioning well known axioms or pundits. anyway, i should be talking about myself. i have my own problems. i can't state my feelings. that is as far as i will go because i can't talk about it. then it can't be cured. irony. now i am thinking about ut. it's pretty overwhelming. in germany my high school graduating class had about 70 people. yup. but i will do fine. i am just having these high expectations in college. i want to find my dead poet society"""" - teacher. someone that will point me in the right direction. that makes learning an adventure. right now, i still have to force myself to do homework. time is up!

"well i figured since i want to go to bed at midnight i would write for 20 minutes now so i don't forget. i always tend to think at night. stuff runs through my mind because i let it wander. i don't know if this is a bad thing or a good thing, but i do it anyway. i just finished studying for a chemistry test tomorrow. it is my first college test so i am a little nervous. i know that i have to do well in all my classes in order to get into medical school. i think i will do fine though. i have done all that stuff before in high school. so far the largest difference i have noticed between high school and college is that the professor expects you to know what he or she is talking about. they don't explain things as thoroughly as they do in high school. oh well i guess i will become accustomed to it. i don't mind the reading i have to do so that isn't too bad. i have met a lot of new people here and i like the college a lot. one thing i do want though is a girlfriend. i like this one girl but she has a boyfriend back home so it is kind of hard. i seem to be able to pick out the ones that have boyfriends all ready. i was in the same situation almost with one of my good friends that just left for the navy. i say almost because she liked me also, but had been going on with her boyfriend for a long time. we were friends back in seventh grade but then she moved and we kind of kept in touch through the years and then on day she called and i hadn't heard from her in over a year. i told her that we had to get together and do something. so i went over to her house for spring break and we spent the next two weeks together. i had so much fun. i felt as though we were meant for each other. it is kind of hard to explain the feeling i had when i was around her. well i told her and she said that she liked me too but couldn't break up with her boyfriend and then go out with me. i asked her why not and she said that she couldn't be with me and then have to leave for the navy. i talked to some of my friends and they said that it was because she knew that i would not let her leave and her current boyfriend would. i don't know if that is it or not, but regardless we went out a whole lot and spent a bunch of time together. i always had a wonderful time with her. then i left and then she left. i came here and she is in chicago for boot camp. i miss her a lot. then i met this one girl from my high school, which i knew but not that well. in the last few weeks we have become real good friends. she reminds me of my friend in the navy, and i can't figure out if that is one of the reasons that i like her or not. i think it might play a bit of a role in it, but i am not sure. well she has a boyfriend also so i am in the same position as before only i am not sure how she feels towards me. i received a post card from my friend in the navy today. it felt good to hear from her. i have to write her back tomorrow. well it is midnight so i think i am going to head to bed. i know that i will continue to think through the night. that is just what i do.

"college is amazing. my room, roommate, suitemates are all amazing. however, that call home always does it. i'm so in love yet my dad has to bring me down. i understand i'm only 18 and that they're thousands of fish in the sea, however, i'm in love with this one. i know i am because when i'm with her i'm the happiest man alive. yet at the moment, my feelings are so far removed from her. i understand that this is my father in my brain and my rational thinking has overcome my emotional side. he says not to let her visit, however, i must see her. he will not stop my but he's trying to open me up to the thousands of women here at ut-austin. i don't know, i think about it every day. she's different then the girls i've ever been with. i guess, she's different then the girls my parents want me to be with. she is poor and has nothing to offer, yet i'm so in love. and i know. never have i felt this way for a girl before in my life. i would do anything for her, i mean. this assignment of writing for 20 minutes is nothing. i could sit here for 20 hrs weighing the pros and cons and just keep writing. its not  a difficult task. she is not causing me to be depressed. you know?  how people can sometimes get all depressed over their long distance relationships and stress out. i am eating like a madman as always. going out at night, with girls, and partying. you know?  i get my homework done and study hard. i work out, pledge my freaking frat and play lacrosse. i'm doing everything and performing well for me as well as my parents so why the fuck can't i just be allowed to have the one woman in life that makes me happy. i understand that i'm young, yet this relationship is not difficult for me. its the second time i've ever been in a long distance relationship. the first one was a bust and i vowed to never do it again. so this past summer  i went to camp sabra at the lake of the ozarks to be a counselor. well, i wasn't intending on meeting anyone, however, i believe 100% that that word called 'fate' has true meaning. the first day we hit it off. i wasn't intending on anything. all i wanted to do was have a productive summer and come to ut free of love. however, you can't control love when it is real. it just happened. and i don't regret however i sometimes wonder if i didn't have her, what life for me would be like. i mean, i'm with all my buddies. they don't have girl friends or anything coming into ut and its not like they've all of a sudden found someone. i understand its only the first week, but i truly believe that what i've shared with this gorgeous somewhat deprived southern belle from nashville is impossible to ever experience with anyone else. of course i could experience love with another baby, but do i really want too?  i mean, there is no way that the things we have been through together can ever be replayed. i know deep down inside that i am in love with this girl. its tough because she's not here. but what if she was here?  lets say she ends up going to ut or acc, as talked about next year?  what if my girlfriend is here dad?  what if she lives in austin?  then what, i mean i've got a girlfriend at school now, right?  its not like this is killing me. or maybe it is. look, i'm in love. i know i am. with my love, i have no worries whatsoever. i don't think about anything else when i'm with her. i'm completely content. so get off me. i'm planning on keeping my studies up the whole year, i've signed with a wonderful fraternity, i'm playing lacrosse for the university of texas-austin. i have an active social life. not to brag, you know. but i'm doing everything a college boy should be doing: i'm enjoying myself, and to let this get in the way is ridiculous. one must understand, this situation is not in the way. its not holding me back from talking to other girls. however, i do not become intimate with these ladies. so what?  i'll be fine, i will see my love when we visit. i just don't understand. its very stressful, but i'm handling it. you see, my older brother went through the same kind of shit, but he screwed up. he wasn't able to function and messed around freshmen year in college and ended up on academic probation. i thought, damn what if that happens to me?  but its not a worry. i'm at college, its awesome, and i'm doing just fine. we're not holding on to each other. we are in love and have so many dreams we want to fulfill. its not like i'm crying all day to my buddies that i missed her. i rarely ever do that. i'm 120% functional. you know?  i don't know, i really don't know what the hell i just spattered out. i'm in love g-d damn-it. and i'm happy. i just have to relax and get my father's controlling voice removed from my head. i hope i fulfilled the assignment. its been 20 minutes of continuous writing. guess what, my mind still tells me i'm in love. ain't that the darndest thing. alright, time to go ponder. maybe i'm relieved now. see you.

"ok well i'm thinking about how long of a day it was, i got to school kind of late and i was almost late to my first class. i'm not really smelling anything right now because my nose is a little stuffy and runny i think it is due to my girlfriend who has been getting sick lately, we went to buy tylenol cold at the target on 35. i just spoke to here and she said that she was going to take a little nap and i told her not to because she was complaining all day that she had so much to do and there wasn't any time to do it. well she didn't listen to me she said for me to call her at 7:15 if she hasnt called me. she went with me to psy class today even though she already took it last semester. she was very moved by the way the professor was. i think she said i wish i had him for my psy class. i told before that he was very cool like our communications teacher dr. daly who is a very cool teacher as well, his class is awesome he's so charismatic, today we had a supplemental discussion for that class and i have my girlfriends friend from back home in that class who just broke up with her boyfriend whom she had been going out with for about two years or so, and we were just talking and she was telling me how she hated our comm. class because all they talk about in that class is relationships and she feels sad every time he uses one of the students as examples, now on the topic of my girlfriends friends. by the way her name is desiree and she is beautiful and i love her a lot, i don't know when and where but someday we plan on getting married, i think we are different than most couples, i know that everybody probably says that but i really do think that we are because yes we spend a lot of time together and i hear that that is a bad thing but were different because we involve god in our relationship, not as much as we should but more than most couples i think, in the summer we read the bible every night for the last couple of weeks. but since we got up here, we haven't read it at all, i think its because were so happy with each other and we love to spend time with one another that its hard to do something else besides kissing and having sex at night. now back to her other friend named nancy. well she is rooming with desiree's old roommate kelly, and well a few days ago kelly had a talk with nancy, she was really mad from what i hear because she took the time to underline in the contract that no one else has permission to stay for more than three consecutive nights in their apt. without some kind of notice, and well nancy has a boyfriend who is always over there and kelly gets really mad. me and desiree were thinking that she is just jealous because her boyfriend isn't over there as much as he should be. like my roommate said that he wasn't going to talk to his ex when he came up here because she broke up with him last year when she was still in high school and he was up here. well now that she is up here too, he said that he was not going to talk to her at all, well shit that didn't last very long, just the other night he stayed at her dorm because they had to homework for the same class that they both share. hmm. what a coincidence, i mean me and my girlfriend had a class last together too and i think that that helped out a lot because no matter if we didn't see each other every day we definetly saw each other on those days that we had class, i mean we really werent together yet but that certainly helped out our relationship a lot. my friend oj keeps calling me because he wants to go eat at the olive garden and i told him that i don't know because i running tight on money and i kind of got in trouble the other day with my mom because i went on a little shopping spree and spent a good amount of money at diesel. the part that she got mad at was the jeans that i bought for 100 dollars and that's because they were on sale. she said imagine how many shirts u could have bought with that. so i don't know if ill go but i do want to play him in ncaa 2005 college football that's like our fav game and my roommate just bought a big screen with a surround sound so its awesome to play on that i haven't even tried it i think i'm going right now to go play laterz!

"i keep coughing so much in class i think i probably annoy the crap out o everybody there. i should stop smoking so much. it feels good to be back in school, seeing friends again, but i miss my mom. she is wittiog all the way in ethiopia and i'm over here. it sucks. but there is always christmas time, so it is not that bad. i have no idea what that holiday is going to be like. this guy just bumped in to me an did not even apologize. i hate it when people do that. he just walks by like it's okay to knock people into a damn computer screen. jerk. i don't understand how i am going to keep writing for twenty minutes. the way i type it will probably be the worst thing anyone has ever read. i tend to type fast and then screw up a lot along the way. there is a guy near me talking a bout the swiss air crash and jerry mcguire. i hate baseball so i couldn't care less. there goes my cough again. i got to get home soon, i got a date. this is really a nice girl and i hope it works out, but i will probably spend the hold time coughing anyway. the guy is now talking about wire services. what in the world are wire services. i am getting kind of thirsty and i should get a drink of water, but i do not know where the water fountains in this library are. i hate asking people about it, i guess i feel stupid. i wonder what the guys who read this stuff do. do they analyze it of just laugh at the kind of things people come up with. i would probably laugh a lot. if this was me reading it i would be cracking up. then a gain i am kind of a jerk. what i don't understated about the internet is how people think its so much phone. i like e mail and research its great. but this whole surfing the web for hours like its some sort of athletic event seems kinds stupid. i thinks i sound like some commercial  i saw. its amazing how tv effects you like that. you watch some stupid ditcom and then start using the vocab all over the palace. it hate the people who keep going yadda yadda because of seinfeld. but then again i pick up enough catch [phrases anyway. i just looked at  the watch, another ten minutes of writing. this is really weird. this is the first psych class i have taken and so far i enjoyed it. this is a different kind of activity. i have difficulty understanding how this helps us learn anything, but then again i am cynical by nature. the prof was talking about the brain today and it was really technical  i thought the class would not be like that. not that i mind or i did not understand it, it was just a surprise. somebody once told that psych classes are some of the most fun, i hope he is right. i don't see much of him anymore, he got married and has kids. so his life really changes. he's like my brother, wee used to hang out and drink beer all the time and go to games and stuff like that. now he only wants to take his baby to the children's museum and  do family things. i love the kid, but i miss the old him who would drive off to new orleans on a whim because he wanted a sandwich form a particular cafe. it's funny who people change. i' feel i have changed in college. i would not say i grew up, i just found out things about myself that i would not have ordinarily known like what it's like to be away form all the comforts of home and how i would handle it. or to be away form africa and in america again. i kind of glorified it but it did not turn out that way. i hope that december comes so, i am looking forward to all my friends and my parent, an my dog . i want to get a dog hear but the apt does not allow it so i guess i am stuck. my place is too small anyway. i have not really seen that  many apt in austin that allow pets. but i am sure there a lot. hey that girl is really cute.

"i am eating a hershey's bar with almonds. i told myself that i would only eat one little square of it, but as i can see, that didn't happen. you would think that eating chocolate would spoil my appetite, but actually it's making me more hungry. for more sweets. that's interesting.      as i'm typing, those little notices that people are signing on aol instant messenger keep popping up, and for some reason the cursor on my laptop keeps moving over the words i've already typed, so i have to keep going back and deleting and starting over. annoying.    over the labor day weekend, which happened to include my birthday, by the way. on that note, i used to not like having a birthday so near a quote """"holiday"""" because all of my school friends would have some vacation of some sort planned, and i wouldn't be able to get together with all of them. now that i've entered college (smile), i've grown - in two short weeks - to love having a long weekend for my birthday. to spend with special people (bigger smile). anyways, this weekend (my computer did that thing again) i celebrated my 18th birthday with my family and my best friend.     my mom used to attend ut austin, in fact, both of my parents did. unfortunately, due to health complications she was forced to transfer to another college back home. anyways, she is a registered nurse, although she took maternity leave long ago, and at the moment she's decided not to go back to work until my little brother gets into his middle-elementary years.    my dad is a self-employed architect. he used to work for a large corporation in dallas, but hardly had time to have a life. a life away from work, that is. my mom likes to say that when i was a baby, she would have to show me a picture - ahhhh! my best friend just called! - she'd say that she would have to show me a picture of my dad and say: """"look, there's your daddy. """"  now my brother has the luxury of him coaching his fall baseball teams, and attending soccer practices, and taxi-ing him to karate class and piano lessons.    my little brother, matthew, was born when i was nearing 10 years old. currently he is seven years old, in second grade. he came as a huge surprise, being as how physicians had told my mom that she was infertile. but obviously, as my case proved, they were wrong. he is very active, and shows so much love that i don't know how such a little body can produce it. right now he's almost infatuated with copying my best friend, patrick.    speaking of patrick, i met him in high school. we both attended health careers high school, a magnet school in san antonio. by chance, we've had a few classes together over the years, and, by chance, we only just met each other at the end of senior year. that was largely due to our parent's cooperative involvement in putting together project graduation for our senior class, to be held the night of graduation. actually, we've been aware of each others presence for awhile now, being as how our school is relatively small in size, housing around 1000 students total; around 204 in my class. i didn't get to what i was saying, but i guess i'll leave the juicy stuff for next time.

"well my experience so far up in this large city has been one i won't forget. i've several new people but most of the people i am with are the one's that i have known all my life. it's amazing how much you can share with your roomate although i've known her all my life. i just feel bummed cause i'm so far from home i miss my parents and most of my family. and of course there are boy problems too. john who i have liked forever doesn't even give me the time of day. which totally bites. i just wish he would notice me and then there is my kind of boyfriend back home whom i need to let go but right now he is the only thing that is holding me up from completely losing it. it's scary up here. and being mexican really doesn't help either. i feel like an ugly duckling up here. i feel that people are looking at me different because i don't look like them. or maybe i'm just very parnoid about meeting new people. it's funny though, i have been waiting for this experience for most of my teenage years and now that it is here i just want to go home to the normal for me at least. it is just so frustrating when your sitting in a classroom of more than 600 people and you have no one to talk to. i know i should start meeting new people and all but it's just very scary for me and i don't even know why. i evy alot of people up here. i evy those that can just sit next to a person and be like   hey my name is becky   or whatever. that just one of my many problems. i know they are stupid but they really freak me out when i start to think about them. so most of the time i try to stay away from things like this that will make me think of all that is confusing in my life. what i do not know is if i can live here in austin and go to school here for 5 years. when i came to orientation at the business college they had posted in big letters   welcome class of 2007   me and my roomate were like what we have to be here 5 years that is crazy. everyone that i left behind back home all told me that these were going to be the best years of my life. and that i was going to meet my life long friends. so far i truly believe that all of us from san benito will remain friends the rest of our lives. i guess you could say that we are each others shoulder to lean. we always go out together, eat together, and just hang out together. i know it is against school policy and all but before school started we had a big sleep over and everyone just hung and enjoyed each others company. i liked that alot. i think it brought us closer and we learned to appreciate that connection we had with one another. i just know they will be there when i break down and cry about everything that i have been building up inside my head. thank god i knew my roommate because my other girlfriend is having some difficulty with her roommate and i'm just fortunate not to have that problem. it's like diana and me our soulmates we just didn't realize it til now. it's funny cause we share the same thoughts about most stuff. and we even spend countless hours talking about boys and other things bothering us, but it is mostly boys! i love her a great deal and i am extremly grateful for her. i also have a friend back home who i used to work with and he is great too. he calls me and leaves me inspirational messages on my phone which always brings  a smile to my face when i'm struggling to get to class in the blazing hot sun. but god blessed me with really great friends.

"i can't believe he just showed up like that and expected me to let him in of course i let him in anyway. what is this control he has over me? i can't make thoughts work clearly when he looks at me. all i see are blue eyes and red hair. deep, deep blueness. there i get lost into submission. is it me? is it all just something i do to myself? where are the lines i should be drawing. why isn't easier to know what the right thing to do is? i wonder if he's sleeping right now? i know he's home. maybe i should knock on his window until he wakes up and lets me sleep next to him? his room is so close just right down stairs. i know he look up at me every night through his window. he's sees everybody i let in. i'll have to remember in the future the consequences of sleeping with neighbors; but what if they have crazy red hair and perfect hands? it will be an interesting year. i wonder if he'll end up hating me? or me him? no. we can at least be friends. although, it's hard sometimes. especially with the angel downstairs. ha! no pun intended. i just don't understand where all the anger inside him comes from. we're so different. i'm so full of love and he's so scared of love. maybe he just fearful and that's why he becomes so overwhelmed with anger; or maybe he's just passionate. i think that might be part of it. i read his palms and his heart line was off the chart! he asked me when i met him if i thought we'd be dangerous together and i said, """"i'm not dangerous with anybody,"""" but i'm begging to change my mind. i wish i could see inside him. usually i can read strait through boys, but he is an enigma. i guess i'll just start looking harder. if i go down there right now i know he'll wake up and be happy to see me. i'm sure he thought about me all night after the afternoon we had together. why is it that you can see someone who fits every requirement you have for the perfect mate, but if there's no chemistry there's no relationship  at least romantically. then you might met someone who isn't your type at all, maybe you don't even really like the same music or have the same lifestyle, but if there's chemistry you can't resist each other. who casts the spells on us? who laughs at our bumbling confusion? is it all a matter of having the ideal children? are the people we have 'chemistry' with the people who have the perfect complementary set of genes to our own? if so, how does my body know? do my electrons match up perfectly with the spin cycles of theirs?

"it is 7:30 right now and i have to write for 20 minutes. my roommate is going to come in here and read this and make fun of me. she said she would be home at 7;30 i bet it will be a lot later. damn, i'm really bad at typing, iwish i did't have to look at the keyboard while i did this. i wonder who will be reading this thing. i would really like to read someone elses. i hope after this i can get back on that pretesting thing because it sure as hell wasn't working for me earlier. what if i can never get back on it. i'll probably fail this class. man, i just got a call from someone at atm. i could see it on the caller id. shit, that means i'm going to have to calle them back and pay for the long distance. i couldn't answer it and let it skrew up my thinking process. ireally wonder who is going to read this. i wonder how much more time i have. i don't want to look at the clock that will make it seem worse. i wonder what my parents are doing. i bet they're pretty bored. i really suck at typing maybe i should take keyboarding class or something, am i going to run out of room here? it looks like it, oh no ican keep going. i feel like doing something fun. i wish bryce would stop calling so damn much. watch him get on line and be able to read this. iwonder if thatsa possible. i bet you have to know my social security number or some thing. but the university knows it. i wonder if the computer is like timing me or something. my mom would be really proud of me for doing this she doesn't think i know what i'm doing when it come to computers. my roommated will also be impressed when she come home from whereever she is. i bet this would be a lot harder to do in that class room with 400 people. iwould probably start writing about the people around us. by the time i finish a sentence i've already thought about 10,000 other things. i wonder if other peoples are going to be like this. they are probably going to talk about something worthwhile. i used to think it was worthwild. i hear voices outside my window i wonder if they can see me. they're probably saying that girl looks at th e keyboard when she type instead of the screen. wow time is going by really fast, i only have like 4 more minutes. i wonder what will be done with this and if i will ever see it again. where the hell is lindsay? i think i'm starting to get a crick in my neck. i have 2 more minutes. computers are pretty fun i wish i didn't have such early classes. i keep thinking some one is going to knock on my door. geez my suitemate is really weird. i wonder what she does. damn almost all my thoughts from 20 minutes recorded. that is pretty cool. shoul;d i read over it?

"   i'm not sure about how to do this assignment. . if i'm doing this right or not. i guess i'm a little bit nervous about this. i hope that this isn't for a grade, but i guess it is because it's an assignment. well, if it's for a grade, i guess that i can't really have a   wrong   answer because it's what i'm thinking, and this is what i'm thinking. i really like rockwell church.   charade   is a really good song. i don't know if he's going to take off for um what's it called. grammar and whatnot. i hope not. i don't really know what to write. i hope my clicking of the keys isn't bothering ali. wow. the song ended, and it's very quiet now. good thing another one just started. ooh natalie cole is awesome. i'm glad that there's the random functin on my mp3 player. i really love her voice. i wonder when drew's going to call me. he said he would call me back a little later--after frisbee golf,and that was almost a couple of hours ago. wow. it's only been 4 minutes. twenty minutes is a long time to write. i hope it goes by fast. but then again, it's time,which is constant, so i hope that i can just write for 20 minutes. that's about 4 or 5 songs. i can do that. what if i have to go to the bathroom in the middle of this or i someone calls on the phone for me. what if drew calls for me in the middle of this. i hope he doesn't get mad if i don't answer the phone. this is probably one of my better assignments. it's very interesting. i wonder what ali meant when she said,   oh, wow   when i told her about this. hmm. frappucino. i think i'm a good speller. i wonder if that's just easy for me to spell or if i spelled it wrong. anyway- ali didn't know. i hope that doesn't change my stream of conciousness or something like that. people asking questions that is. i wonder if the genius writers wrote in stream of conciousness. i wonder if i could be a genius writer. probably not. hmmm don't know what to write. i don't really know this song. i'm glad my bed is near my chair so i can lean back in my chair and stick my legs on the bed. that's comfortable. i really like to sit cross-legged. wow. that's aweird thing to write. . but i bet that this isn't hte weirdest thing on the scale of weird stream of conciousness writings.  i think i really like this assignment. good one, pennebaker!  i wonder if people call him pennebaker. good ol pennebaker. unkie pennebaker. haha. what a great name. wow. sounds like i'm brown-nosing. ehh. . oh well. . people can think what they want. i like the name. lalalalalala. . reminds me of mrs. blount. wow. she was a good teacher. i liked her a lot. she gave me good grades too. i'm so. so. i don't know. i think i maybe want to eat that tin roof ice cream in the freezer, but i'm not sure about that. wow. my keyboard is really loud. i hope it's not bugging ali. but it's ok. i think she's enthralled in her cutting out of magazines. that's the problem with random on the mp3 player. it plays songs that i don't even really like, but maybe liked at one time, or it's a song that i don't like of a group i like. always chooses the bad ones. i hope that people don't walk by the door and hear this music and think that i have bad taste in music. i'm sure that i know more than so many people on this floor who think they know stuff just cause they know artists who are really new but in reality have been out for years, who i've known about for so long. i wonder if i used the   who   correctly. is it supposed to be whom?  i wonder. i bet that the readers are having a hay day with this. what's that supposed to mean anyway? a   hay-day?    i actually don't really care about that. so. when's drew going to call? i think i'm getting antsy because i have about 5 minutes left. and i think i can't think anymore. how would that be i wonder. if you couldn't think. i guess you would be doing nothing? it boggles my mind. and for that matter. you can't ever be doing nothing. reminds me of that phantom tollboth book. . the kid was told to do nothing, so he just sat there. but by sitting there he was doing something. just not anything of great importance, i guess. wow. that was a great book. i wonder if people realize it's greatness. i say wow a lot. ali's excited because this song i'm listening to said   amarillo,   and she's from little borger. this is a nice song. the random function actually picked a good one. i wish i could do that little sound that people do with their mouths. the one that can call horses. . i can't do that. ali just did it. man. almost done. yay!! i wonder if it's still stream of conciousness if you keep checking on the clock. . it seems like it'd be interrupting the stream by looking at it. i don't think that makes a lot of sense. but then again, i don't think that much i do makes a lot of sense. or say rather.  i need to dry my hair. . and yes! i can do it in about. . 10 seconds. yay! i'm free ",1
"okay, i am starting to write for this assignment. i don't really know what i'm supposed to write, but i guess it's sort of like a journal and i'm supposed to write whatever i am thinking. i am kind of overwhelmed by school right now. it is so big here, and it's kind scary. i'm used to knowing everyone around, but here i don't know anyone. friends is on right now. it's pretty funny. i miss being in houston where everything is normal. i'm not used to the times shows come on here. this sounds really stupid, like i am just rambling on about nothing. friends is funny. am i doing this right? i don't know if this is what y'all are asking me to do. i miss john, the guy i am dating from houston. i don't really want anything serious with him, but i like him a lot so i am kind of confused on what i should do. should i have my fun and not date someone i really like a lot, or should i date him and maybe miss out on opportunities to have fun at school. i don't know i am not sure. and then there is my exboyfriend ricky. i don't want to be with him, but sometimes i miss him. i think it is only when i think back on high school i think about the good times we had and i miss that. i also don't like it that maybe i made the wrong choice in not wanting him and moving on. what if i totally regret it in the future, and i want him back, but he doesn't want me. that would be horrible. i don't know. i'm just pretty confused right now. i don't know what i want about anything. it's hard getting used to everything around here. i miss the show 90210. i was just thinking about it for some weird reason. that used to be my favorite show, but it got cancelled. i'm supposed to go to a frat party tonight but i don't know if i'm going to go or not. my roommate doesn't want to go cause she needs to do work. she's the same major as me. she's a pretty good influence on me. she gets me to go to meetings and stuff that i probably wouldn't go to if it weren't for her dragging me to them. i am filming the volley ball game on saturday for a live broadcast. i'm glad i am getting involved somehow. i tried to get tickets to the ou game, but i couldn't they were already sold out when i was supposed to get them. i'm pretty bored right now. i probably have lots of grammar mistakes in here, but since i'm free writing, i don't think it really matters. at least i hope it doesn't matter. i'm a little scared about grades. i hope tests and stuff are not too hard. i'm not really thinking about anything right now, so i have nothing to right except that i have nothing in my head. this is a little hard; to right only what you are thinking and not thinking of something to write. i'm glad it rained today, it was nice. i love the rain. ever since i was a life guard i have loved the rain, cause we got to close the pool and sit around getting paid for doing nothing a miss those days, back in the summer of my freshmen year. everything was so easy back then, it kind of makes me sad thinking about it, but oh well, i guess i'll make new memories, and have a different kind if fun. okay, well my time is up.

"today i woke up to the sun sinning in to the room and it gave me much joy. the warm sun rays lighting up the room starts a day off very nicely. sweetie now that made me feel all warm and fussy in side. i just had to sit back and take it in for a few moments before closing the chat window. she called me sweetie, wow! i hope she knows that made me feel special. i hope i make her feel special. because she is special to me. joanna what a unique name. it is a lovely name. one with two capital letters. laptops, this is so cool i am typing on a laptop, i wish i could have my own. maybe i could save some money some how. i wonder if my mom will give me some for it. hmmm. must likely not. my sis is doing better. she needs to eat more healthy. this summer was a great summer. god really blessed me. i worked a lot help on the house met one great family and to great friends in it. i got all the classes i wanted to switch in to these fall. so awesome. god is awesome. i am so bless through his love. i pray i make the most of it and continue be focused. i have so much time and yet i always want things faster. i seem to want it now. but time and patients will help me through. sweetie wow i just can't get over it. i am so lucky to have some like that in my life. just to look at her brings me joy. and those eyes. i love getting lost in those eyes. what if i didn't say anything? will she turn away? will she be embarrassed? i hope not. does she feel the same way? if she does is this the one? or maybe it is another i have not met. i wish i knew. i have to be patient. all good things come in time. i wonder if she knows that i wonder what she is doing sometimes. does she do the same? when can i see her again. when is too soon to talk to her. what is to much? who knows! her smile is so beautiful. no wonder i am so at tracked to her. the smile is the first things i notice in a girl. and my mom likes her too, what are the odds. something must be right. maybe i thinking too far ahead. all i now is i like it. i like joanna and she likes me. that is what i know. i know i want to see more of her but that will have to go slow because school is why i am here in austin. maybe over christmas we can see more of each other.

"at first when i came to ut i was really scared that i was not going to make any friends. right away i met many people and made many acquaintances. i am not sure i have made any really good friends. i feel lonely many of the times even though i am constantly around different people. for me to feel good is to be loved and that is not happening. first of all, i have no family near me which removes that area of love. my best friend, milan, is one who i can turn to. or so i thought. he seemed to have become distant from me than usual and i did not appreciate it. actually it made me jealous because i need attention. so then i began to think that i might like him more than a friend. one of my good friends ended up telling him that i like him. it made things worse than before. but now he likes me and still wants to date other people. i think i really like him so this bugs me. i don't know what i should tell him. i think that he does not like me the way i like him. he told me he was going to come over today but he did not. he did not even bother to call and let me know that he was not going to come. he is probably out, clubbing or something. it was rude of him to not even give me a call. situations such as these make we wonder if anyone really does care about me. i feel like some how i am always betrayed. why is that? i wish i could be happy in my life. that is all that i ask for and wish for in my life. i feel like nothing really makes me happy. i am not saying i am always sad and my life sucks because this is not the case. i am just saying that sometimes i am sad and maybe sometimes i am content with my life. content is not good enough for me. i want true happiness and not by myself but with another person. i am trying to find that happiness but it is way out of my reach. why is that? why me? i ask myself these questions all the time and ponder to myself. i think that in life i will never really be successful or anything because i get lonely really easily. i can't even go to the store by myself or to the grocery store. i need someone to go with me. is that a bad thing? i think that it is because i am not very independent. i want to have someone with me all the time because i like the company. my best friend also tells me that i crave attention. i don't know about all that. maybe i do though, who knows? school is stressful for me. there is so much studying to do and i feel like i have no time to do it. there is time though but i don't like to be alone. and to study you need to be alone to really get things done right. i guess i just need to figure out my stuff and then everything will be ok. hopefully all will work out best.

"i'm sitting all stressed out. for the first time since if got to ut i've had to study and do homework for a large period of time. i guess for the first time since i've gotten here i'm starting to realize how much work its going to take. the fraternity stage is getting old. they don't tell you that you are going to be busy about everyday of the week doing sometimes pointless stuff. i'm new to the fraternity scene and already i'm feeling somewhat burned out. and paying a lot of money to clean the frat bathrooms isn't my idea of fun anyway. even drinking is getting old. its almost to the point that you can expect to get messed up every night and that takes the fun out of the whole thing. i don't like admitting this to myself but it would be nice to see someone from the family right now. i'm not homesick just kind of feel like i'm missing out on everything that's going on in my brothers and parents life. it's hard to deal with the fact that the family life is never going to be the same again which is somewhat of a relief but also a little scary. at least i am enjoying living with my roommates. they were my friends before i came here but i am a bit surprised to how good we are getting along. with my friend dying last week i found myself today thinking i saw him in other people. the reality of death has hardly set in on me. his picture of him alive is hanging right in front of me, but its hard to comprehend there is no more life in him. i almost feel like all my experiences with him were pointless because he is dead. even seeing him in an open casket i failed to connect him laying there to his death. i attribute this to the fact that this is the first person in my life that i was close to that has died. it's weird but it will help me in the future to deal with the harshness of death. more than ever i think along the lines of life after death. i'm firm in my beliefs regarding the subject but i somewhat question what its really like. i guess you never take death seriously until it effects you on the personal level. i hear of people dying everyday but it has never registered to me how important everyone's life his to someone else out there. and above all i guess the possibility of death seems more likely. i feel less likely to put myself in situations where my life is on the line.

"i can't believe it!  it's really happening!  my pulse is racing like mad. so this is what it's like. now i finally know what it feels like. just a few more steps. i wonder if he is going to get any sleep tonight!?  i sure won't!  well, of course i have a million deadlines to meet tomorrow so i'll be up late anyway. but oh! i'm so so excited!  yes!  yes!  i can't believe it is finally happening. wait! calm down. we aren't officially a couple yet. what if i end up not liking him?  that would be horrible. oh great, i wonder how long it'll take me to finish those calculus problems?  i'll get it done. don't you always, amy?  i can't believe bob did it!  he really did it!  he is the miracle worker. if things turn out all right i will owe him more than i can ever repay. i wonder what steve is doing in malaysia right now?  an entire month!  i'll likely clean out his refrigerator by then. omigosh!  food, lunch tomorrow, what will i ever say to him?  he is perfect in every way imaginable. it is so important for him to think of me the same way. well, maybe not perfect, but certainly dynamic. who would have ever thought!  good things do indeed come to those who wait!  oh, i'll have to remember to sign the poster he made tomorrow morning. i hope steve's alarm clock is reliable and i don't oversleep. that would be tragic if i slept 'til noon and missed the lunch. thank goodness portia is coming along. i will definitely need her support as well as bob's. just having her there will take away some of the tension and put me more at ease. i'll have to rehearse what i say beforehand. things can only get better from here, right? hopefully. oh, i'm so nervous!  he will be too. maybe even more so. it'll be ok. why in the world do humans put themselves through such torture. maybe love is really worth it?

"my parents just dropped me off at my dorm room and they are headed home to houston. they came up for the football game and to see me. my mom calls me every day, whether it be to see if i'm up for school or  if just to see what i'm doing for the day. gosh, i'm starving right now and my friend just ate all of his taco bell. i wish he would have saved some for me. when i get done typing i'm going to go find some grub. oh, speaking of food, this morning i ate an awesome breakfast buffet at the double tree with my parents. i just got a computer; i don't know why i'm using my friend, matt's, computer. his roommate just  picked up the phone and disconnected me. but, luckily i got right back on. i have so much reading to do today for philosophy, chemistry, and nutrition. i hope it doesn't take too long because i'm so tiered  and i want to take a nap. every time i wake up from sleeping i feel as though i'm getting more and more sick. i'm on different medications for my asthma, allergies, and my congestion. the good thing is that i have a doctor's appt. on friday. so hopefully i can hang in 'til then. i met a girl that lives down the hall from me named jenny when i moved in my dorm and it turns out that we long lost sisters. well,  not really, but we do have absolutely everything in common. it really is weird how alike we are. i feel so lazy staying in side studying on a sunny sunday afternoon. i would love to go swimming right now. i hope that this writing assignment gets to janel seagal or whomever it is supposed to go to. well, it's over and i'm off to eat!!  good-bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"i really think the professor is funny and can hold the class' attention.    i am listening to a dave matthew's cd. i was never really a big fan of his until recently. my roommate and best friend ( she is also taking this class) loves dave matthews. she asked me to go to his concert with her months in advance. i had heard a few of his songs, and even though i wasn't crazy about them, i agreed to go. it was two weeks before the concert and a really good friend of ours was moving to houston to go to graduate school. dave m. was going to be in houston on friday and austin on saturday. so robyn ( my roommate) decided to sell her tickets and we would help justin move and see the concert in houston. on our way to houston the u-haul had a blow out and a few other tragadies occured, forcing us to miss the concert. robyn was devastaed. so saturday we headed back to austin and bought tickets to go. after several beers we were there. somehow i got seperated from my friends. when we found each other i cried, i think it was from the alchol. anyways, we happened to be at the right place at the right time and a guy came up to us and brought us armbands to go to the front of the stage. i pushed my was to the very front and managed to convince a bodygaurd to give me a backstage pass. at the end of the show they took me backstage, gave me flowers and then showed me to dave. i was the only one that wasn't freaking out backstage, so he came up to me. we talked and he signed my ticket (the only thing i had on me). he left but came uback up to me five min later. i was talking to somebody and i saw soomeone come up besaide me. then i felt a hand on my breast (the right one). it was dave, signing my chest. i thought i would faint. his voice is so sexy. later right before he left, he came up to me and kissed me. i love him and will marry him one day.    sorry i wasted ten min blabbing about the same story. i guess the point of the entry to to see how many ways my brain goes. i just thought of something else. i have a crush on a waiter that i work with. i'm a hostess. i haven't had a crucsh like this in a long time. i'm so mad because he didn't work today or yesterday and he won't work until friday. i don't even know anything about him. that's probably why i like him. the last guy i dated was gay. he won't admit it but i know he is. we're not seeing each other anymore. i usually don't talk about guys this much, but for some reason they are on the brain tonight. i just set up my email account today. i'm soo excited. my parents have been bugging me to get one. i'm using a friends computer right now, but we will have the internet set up by friday.  i really hope no one reads this horrible shit. i know it doesn't make any sense and no one cares about any of it. i have to go read 19 chapters for english now. aren't you jealous??!!

"  right now i'm thinking about my poor roomates because one of them, lauren, just found that her little sister woke up this morning to find a bullet hole in her window!  if her bed would've positioned different she would've been dead!  i'm also thinking about my other roomate, anna, she just found out that she didn't get the job that she wanted because she doesn't have time to go through training. i'm also kind of stressed because one of the reasons i came to this school is to do crew and now i'm nervous i'm not going to make the team, aghh. i also am stressed because i have a lot of homerwork to do right now such as reading for psychology and writing my english paper. it's also hard because i miss my family and wonder why i'm here, but then i think how i wouldn't be happier anywhere else. and then i'm wondering about who's going to be reading this and wondering if they think i'm a psycho and then i wonder, is anyone going to be reading this?  go figure. i'm also really excited to be here be because i hate the snow in wisconsin (where i'm from) and am so excited not to  be cold here this winter. but i miss all my friends and hope they are happy where they are to. one of my best friends sisters said that in your first two weeks of college you change in ways more than you could ever fathom and you are such a different person the day you walk into your dorm and the day that you walk out. at college you have time to discover who you really are, and that is really cool you, or at least i, can discover who i am without the distractions of my family, my responsibilities, and my friends. in texas no one knows who i am so i can reinvent myself to be whatever way i like, i can take time to discover if i really like myself and if i don't i have four years to change myself into the person that i want to be, wow i really like that it sounds nice. i just hope that i meet all the people i can and i hope i can get some best friends, i also worry about money and the fact that i'm spending it and not making it. sometimes i'm so stingy. i also worry about how my family is going to survive without me (i know that sounds selfish) but i do a lot of things such as being a peacemaker  between my sisters and cleaning up after my dog who isn't potty-trained and driving my sisters around and running errands for my parents, i'm sure they'll be fine i just in a way hope that they aren't so that they miss me. i hope that this writing piece doesn't seem self-centered because i'm just writing about myself. i just don't know what else to write about. i'm also listening to etta james, i love her voice it is so awesome. oww my hands are sore i could never be a secretary.  my major is actually elementary ed with a minor in psychology. i'm really excited to be a teacher but sometimes i wonder how i can be so excited about it or if i'm setting feminism  back because i will be happy in such a traditional role. but hey whatever floats your boat right?  sometimes i get so excited about the way i'm going to decorate my classroom and the curicullum i'm going to teach. i'm also very excited to take all the classes that are required for my major. they should all be very exciting and hopefully the professors will be enthusiastic because how could they not be they are training us to go into their profession. it's so exciting how college is the step before my real job my whole life i have been preparing for college and now i'm in college and preparing for my next step, my job.

"i just got out of rugby practice. this is the first practice we have had with the veteran players. my body hurts and for some reason i can't sleep so i decided to do this. im too excited to do anything, but think about the next practice. it reminds me of playing soccer in highschool. we should have won state my sophomore year. we had the most talented team i had ever seen at that level. two of the players from that year actually play in the mls. i love rugby. i was never a very imposing guy until about my junior year of highschool and by that time it was too late to play football. so i kept playing soccer. but i've always wanted to just level the other team, and now i can do that. i missed biology this morning because is et my alarm for 7:30 pm instead of 7:30 am. i hate when i do things like that. i miss summer school at ut. it was so much more fun than the fall. everyone hung out together, and we could all get in to any party no matter if we were rushing or not. now i'm lucky if i see one of the people from summer just once a week. fall was suppose to be better. a girl that was my best friend in highschool, and i am absolutely in love with is here now. we have been here about two and a half weeks and we have only spent time together once. all she cares about is her sorority. and when we did hang out all she did was talk about how she was   tired of dealing with it.   why doesn't she quit?  what is her obsession with being a part of something?  i just wish that we were growing closer like we thought we would in college. instead we are moving further and further apart. every guy she meets ends up asking her out on a date. she always some how avoids it, and i don't know why. suddenly, a guy with plans for a very successful career seems much more attarctive than just a regular guy that wants to have fun and hang out. i can't believe i just wrote that because i am one of those guys with plans for a successful career. maybe thats not what she is looking for at all. she lives seven floors below me but instead of coming up to say hi, she just calls. we talk two or three times a day, and when we see eachother we always give eachother subtle compliments. she is the one person who can always make me laugh no matter what kind of mood i'm in. i guess thats what being best friends for five years will do to you. i never knew i thought about her as much as i do. i think i'll go and see ",1
"i have so much on my mind right now. it seems as if my world is changing in every way from every aspect. i have been told by someone close to me (my ex girlfriend) that i have changed. she will not tell me what she means or in what way i have changed. it bothers me more and more all the time. i can't see how i have changed. i have looked at every aspect of my life and personality and have yet to find any feeling different than that which i felt three months ago. i don't want her to be upset with me. i just wish she would tell me why. i feel like i am continuously trying to make everyone around me happy. i spend so much time being the listener of other people's problems. i just sit there and listen to them and when they want feedback i provide it to the best of my ability. the only problem is that sometimes i want to talk to someone. but people do not usually seem to have the same time for me. i usually find my own way of dealing with things such as bowling. bowling is great stress relief. you challenge yourself only and get to throw heavy objects at other heavy objects to improve your score. i am not a violent person at all. but i do feel better after a few games of bowling. i enjoy talking to people about things and helping them with their problems. it just seems like there are a lot of problems out there for which i have no advice to give. it's as if i am letting them down. i am somewhat worried right now. mainly about what will happen when i finish this thought process. i have to go to my fraternity house and help work on one of our pledge class's projects. i am tired and feel overwhelmed by what i have to do. i have schoolwork, friends, and fraternity. any one of these could easily take all of my time. yet here i am trying to budget all of it in. i realize that schoolwork comes first, but i do not want to give up my fun time. i enjoy fraternity but it is a lot of work and takes a lot of time. right now if i had one wish it would be for me to never need sleep again. that would give me another 8 hours to get my daily tasks done. i guess maybe i should think of some good things too. life can't be all bad. i have met so many new people since arriving at ut. i have made friends with people whom i can already tell have the potential to be lifelong friends. college has been like starting over. i have friends who also came to ut. but i rarely see them. and those who i did not get along with, i have yet to see thanks to the incredibly large campus. this is probably one of the most interesting assignments i have ever one. it has been a very long time since i simply sat down and wrote my feelings. in fact, this is the first time since i arrived at ut that i have had the opportunity to think about how i really feel. i actually feel better knowing where i stand on some of the most important aspects of my life. i will definitely make sure to read this again. maybe in a day or so. i might even do this assignment over again on my own in a week or so to see if and how my feelings have changed. i need new shoes. i stepped in a deep water puddle the other day and soaked them inside and out. it is time for a new pair of shoes anyway. i actually saw a student walking to class without shoes the other day. i can't imagine walking down the streets of campus without shoes. why am i thinking about shoes? what time is it? only one minute left. i have really enjoyed this assignment. i hope the upcoming writing assignments are as interesting as this one has been. time is up.

"k. , now i'm writing, but i'm actually kind of confused about what to do. i never really had an assignment such as this one. i feel no pressure since its for a completion grade, so i guess i feel some what good right now. i feel excited about school because i finally finished my schedule and its not going to be so bad after all. i guess my hopes are kind of high right now. i was also excited about your class since i nearly did not get in. at first, the class was closed and so i gave up until i peaked on my roommates computer to see that there was an opening in your class, but it closed again right after i added your class. i also feel kind of stressed because i'm looking for a job at the moment to pay all of my bills and my rent this year. on top of all of this i am now taking more hours this semester than i have ever had, so i guess i have my work cut out for me this year. i am also anxious about finishing this assignment now, i feel compelled to look at the clock and check to see if i have now surpass the 20 minute mark or not. nope, still got quite a bite of time left. so, lets see what else i feel. i also feel somewhat lonely because i had to leave my family and friends at home. even though i have two roommates, they are kind of kept at a distance. my goal this year is to try to succeed at a job, if hired, get a 4. 0, not party as much, and meet more people. i like meeting people, they are all so different and its funny to see likenesses in some. i found that you can also find people that remind you of others you used to know and you automatically share the same felling of like or dislike for that person because of the reminder. confusion and hopefulness is what fills most of me at this point. so, i hope that's ok. part of the confusion i feel is because of this class. i went to the pre-testing section to fill out the form to receive the free hour but the connection was bad or something like that, so now i had to finish assignment one now and do the test afterward if i'm allowed by the computer. ah, my time is almost up and i'm feeling that sense of accomplishment. alright now signing off, feeling good, tonytone.

"     my mind is blank right now. i'm doing this late so i'm nervous that it won't count for credit. i went swimming today, but i wish i hadn't because then this would be on time. sometimes i get homesick, i called my mom today and she was talking about my cousin's wedding. she was surprised that i was willing to pay for my plane ticket there. i think i would regret it if  i didn't go. i've never been to boston before. i hear that it's very historical. i guess they have good clam chowder there, that's what people say. i like clam chowder, but i've only had the kind that comes in a can, so i guess i haven't had real clam chowder. i like a lot of foods from a can. people laugh at me because i still like spaghetti-o's. oh well. they laugh at a lot of things i eat. i really hope this counts for credit. it's only an hour late. i can't believe i forgot, i'm usually so good with homework. if it doesn't count, at least i can still try to get good grades on everything else and maybe i can still get an a. i have to try really hard, i guess even harder now that i realize i am forgetting things, but i want to go to graduate school to get my ph. d. in psychology. so hopefully i'll start remembering to do all my homework. i've been pretty good with keeping up with the reading in all my classes, but it's a lot of reading. i knew college would be a lot more work than high school, but i never imagined all the reading. i'm actually enjoying this writing assignment, i haven't written in a journal or anything in a long time. it feels good to get things out. i used to write poetry too. that made me feel a lot better when i was sad. usually it had to do with guys. they always find a way to make me feel bad. it felt good to be able to turn something bad into something good. i should get back into writing poetry, maybe someday it'll actually be good. i only let a couple people read it and they said they were good, but you never know if they're just saying that or not. i like a couple of them but i usually eventually decide that they're not very good after a while. my two favorite ones are lost somewhere. that really upsets me. i wrote them on a plane. i know i didn't lose them on the plane but when i packed to move here, i still couldn't find them. i wrote them in a spiral but i have a lot of half used spirals. i hope nobody took it. i don't like it when people read my poems. only if i show them and even then it's hard. i don't know why, i  guess it's because they're so personal, it's like i'm completely open and vulnerable when people read my poems. they read my most personal thoughts when they read them. except for a few, some thoughts i just don't put on paper. some things that i'm really not proud of would really not be best on paper because then i'd have to look at them again, or someone else could read it. my parents go through my sister's stuff sometimes, so i assume that they go through mine too. i hope the don't find the pictures from the party at my house. i forgot to bring those and they would probably cut me off if they knew i had a party there. it was fun though. that was the best party. everyone said so, so i know it wasn't just me who had fun. people were dancing and everything and everyone was getting along, usually somebody gets in a fight at parties. boys are so stupid. wouldn't that be a funny last sentence? that seems to be a pretty good conclusion though. it always seems to come around to that.

"i am pretty up set that this is my second time on this assignment. the computer i did this on the first time disconnected the first time i did this exercise. i wish i had time to do it over yesterday but i had to study. studying is taking up alot of my time. more than i expected i would have to. i didn't know that college would be this tough. oh' this is my favorite part of scream. to bad that i have to keep writing. i really dig this assignment. i think it is pretty cool that the ten points is free. t he assignment isn't that  hard to do if you can find time. that is one thing that i wish i had more of. i wish that reading come a hell of alot easier than it does. i just wish that the first time would be enough. but for me it isn't. i wish that some times i was as smart as some people i know. the load of school is really beginning to weigh me down. i guess you guys will label that as stress. i always feel that i am being constantly studied in psy. i always wonder what that would when i do a certain thing or think a certain thought. i really enjoy the class but i am way behind. i have a lot of reading to do in that class . i have alot of catching up to do. especially in that class i am way behind on the chapters. i just want to have some time to do the things i want to do. i want to go an play basketball and lacrosse or just watch tv. i just want to relax and have fun . studying sucks. it makes me sick and it never leaves my mind. always know i should study but i don't. i am so lazy when it comes to doing the tings i have to. man the moving is getting good but i don't want to tell my roommate to turn it off. i like it to o so i wouldn't to turn it off either. i sure do think this twenty minutes seems to be taking a long time. you think that it would go by quickly but not when you want to do something else. i am really excited about next week when i go to see nate and emily in dallas and memphis. i hope i can get a better car so i can make it. i am also excited about the football game this week when we sit on the 40 in row 5. that's sweet. i think this is taking so long. you guy's should make this 15 or 10 minutes long next time. too bad we couldn't do that for the other two due in december. i am two shy to ask the prof. in class, maybe after class or before. he'll probably laugh in my face when i suggest it. the last four minutes are taking too damn long i just want to finish and do something else. i want to watch the movie and not study. studying blows. i wish things were a hell of alot easier. the clock is going to slow. i am sick of writing. this is taking too long to finish. i want to do something else than this poop. the writing is getting very boring. there is another good part of the movie coming up. the movie is pretty good and i have to do this crap. there it went the best part and i missed it because of this crap. it may seem harsh but that is what i am thinking right now and that is what you asked for. yeah i done with this.

"college is awesome though, there is no doubt about that, but it is a little hard to handle well, but sick is an even bigger challenge. i never knew how fun college could actually be, it is crazy. there are so many new people to meet and make friends with, some are nice some not, but hey that is always how it goes. i grew up in austin so finding my way around campus is really no big deal for me. it actually is really nice, because i know my way around the entire city, and plus my parents are here just in case i really need them. plus the fact that it is easier for me to get money that it is for most people. another bonus about having grown up in austin is the fact that i don't have to change my doctor or anything like that, which came in very handy  this week, with me being sick and all. the one thing that bothers me the most about college is the pressure to fit in. i'm in a sorority and absolutely love it, but what i don't love is the fact that when we go to parties, every guy there tries to hand you a beer, and for someone who normally doesn't drink it can get kind of annoying. but even worse is the fact that i start to feel like there is something wrong with me because i am not drinking. like i should be and because i'm not that i am just the weird girl. it is hard for me because i don't want to compromise my moral and religious beliefs, but i continue to find it harder and harder to say no when someone asks me if i want something to drink. it is a very weird and torn feeling, and when i do drink i feel really guilty about it. the one thing that i don't understand is why people think that they need to drink in order to have a good time. after all, most of the time they don't even remember to good time that they had. i myself know that i am having just as much fun as everyone else when i am sober. i am continuing to struggle with this subject daily. i am out of the comfort zone of my high school friends. friends who believed the same things that i did and that didn't feel like they had to drink to have a good time. i  miss them so much, even though i am making new friends here, i still wish that i could see my old friends every day, because just by looking at the expression on my face they can tell when i need a hug because i'm having a bad day or that i just need someone to talk to. it takes a while to form deep relationships with people because no one wants to open up right away and let themselves be vulnerable, they are afraid that if they do it will come back to haunt them, i'm guilty of the same things. it is just going to take time to make really good, deep friendships here at college, but i think that i am on my way. i often wonder if other people are feeling the exact same way that i am. if they are nervous, timid and scared. i guess that is really stupid to ask because i know that they are. i find it so strange how life takes turns that you never would have expected. it is never predictable and never quite goes the way that you have planned it to go. when i first applied for college i swore that i was going to go out of state, but low and behold i changed my mind and here i am  at the university of texas. god himself is just incredible, especially when he throws little things into your life, weather it is for the good or the bad you know that it is in his plan. if you ever really stop to think about what would have happened if you didn't meet one person, how many other of your friends would you have never met. i just don't understand how people can think that there is not a higher power looking over us, because from where is sit today, everything that has happened in my life, and the people that i have met, i know are more than mere coincidence, much much more.

"hi, i have no idea what i'm going to write but who cares, here goes. i'm right now sitting in a small computer lab down in the base ment of jester west, across the where i now reside, in jester east, doing a writing assignment for psychology on what comes in to my mind first. well, my mind is filled with stuff that's definitely not very much to do with a psychological sense. i've been away from books and studying for 2 3'4 years now, and 1 week into ut and 5 classes and 16credit hours later, myhead is sent reeling from the amazing amount of work that i have to do right now. i've totally forgotten everything to do with math and calculus is being thrown onto me at an amazing speed and at an extreme difficulty for me to comprehend. basically, travelling halfway round the world to get hit with books that send you into unconsciousness is definitely not the nicest feeling to have at the moment. and the books. i have never seen paper cost so much in my entire life! damn, now i know why americans are so rich. nah, it's all understandable to me, it's just the matter of settling down into a different environment, and making myself a new circle of friendsfrom scratch. not much in my mind now but complaints and angst now i guess, but it'll be definitely back to my books right after i complete this assignment, and maybe the next. thoughts, ithink that's been settled for now. et's get on to feelings. well i'm feeling hot and bothered right now because we just had a fire drill, i thihnk, i did'nt exactly see any fire and we were allowed back into the building, just a while ago and had a thousand annoyed beings buzzing around the side of the building trying to comprehend in our little minds what the heck is going on here, hwo's the joker who pulled the alarm or wave his stupid little lighter flame below the automatic sensor??jerk!  now, let's get on to sensations. hmm, seems kinda wierd to me what this means. sends the little runners in my itsy brain go wandering all over the place and the component called imagination into overdrive. nah, no dirty thoughts here, it's an educational institution. that's what they all say anyway. well, my senses are kinda dulled right now. a result of chatting last night with my roommate till 1am and waking u p this morning at 7. damn, really hate early mornings, i'm not a morning type of guy but apparently all my classes start way too early in the morning. calculus at that, is that a classic example of stress or what. but what better way to start the ol thinker working everyday with symbols and numbers geting thrown at me and expecting me to understand what's going on?? really don't know actually. don't really care. i guess that's it 20 minutes, mebbe a bit less. tata!

"this is the first time i have come to the library and when i first arrived here, i had no idea how to use the computers. first you have to wait in line and get on a waiting list. then after that you finally get assigned a station to use. i wonder what the point of this assignment is. i think it's just another type of experiment to see what different people are thinking and what affects their thought. how much is someone supposed to write for twenty minutes? people who type fast can take ten minutes and write as much as someone who types slowly and has been writing for twenty minutes. another feeling i have is that of being worried because i am doing this assignment at the last moment. after finishing it, i hope that i will get to class on time but i should because i still have a couple of hours before class starts. i am not sure what to write now. i have thoughts, but they are personal thoughts so i am not going to write them down. i need to start getting to my morning class on time. i've missed it a couple of times now even though all the material i have learned before but i do still need a review so i have to start trying to get there on time. it's strange typing this assignment because all through high school i always had to worry about grammar, sentence structure, and spelling on writing assignments. it feels like i am writing an e-mail to someone because i never worry about any english stuff on those. the only thing i am doing different is that i am capitalizing some of the words which i normally don't do when i write e-mails. i want this twenty minutes to pass by faster so i can move on to the next assignment. these type of assignments are fun because you can say whatever you want and don't have to worry about anything. i like this class so far. i have always wondered what different people are thinking and what their reactions would be they are in the same situations. two more minutes and that will be twenty. i can't wait to go back to houston to visit. i am partially homesick. there are certain things that i want to go back for and other things that i am glad that i left behind.

     man today was a really long day. i'm a so tired but i have all this crap to do still. mostly calculus. i don't know why i took 408d. its so freaking hard. i hope i'll do okay because i just have to. i signed up for tutoring but i don't know how much that'll help. i like this cd i'm listening to. i've listened to it a million times but still like it. man i'm really upset that alias isn't coming on this season. i love that show. it was one thing i was looking forward to this semester. i wish i could be like sydney and kick butt. but instead i'm really boring. man i am so freaking tired. the bathroom has gotten really disgusting. i don't want to be the only one to clean it but i don't want to be the only one to complain that its dirty. i hate cleaning toilets. i mean it would be okay if it were at home because that's like our toilet and i kind of know the germs around. but this is used by four other girls and eeeeek i just can't think about it with out cringing. college is about cleaning bathrooms or learning how to. i guess i'll get used to it. its going okay so far. i mean its fun and all but i don't know. i really really miss home. its weird not coming home to your family everyday. i've met some really cool people but i still miss my old friends. but i'm getting used to going places by myself. woo hoo i'm no longer a person that asks her friends to come with her to the bathroom. sheehs its only been 5 minutes. i don't know how much more i can type. this is a cool assignment not much thinking involved but wait haha i am typing what i am thinking so hey. my fingers are beginning to hurt from typing so much without stopping. wait i missed my favorite song on the cd. oh well. i wish asthma were here with me. we could do some awesome stuff together. but amrita seems really cool we've had great convos. but i'm still scared to make new close friends like i loved my friends from hs. we were such good friends. making new friends involves retrusting strangers and just starting over. its hard for me i'm not one of those people who can socialize with anyone anywhere. i feel really  alone sometimes in a room full of people but i guess that's natural. wow its only been 8 min and 48 seconds. but i shouldn't complain  this is better than doing limits in calculus. lord calculus. i'm so worried i have to do good i have to. after this i should start some calc go over notes and then hwrk. tomorrow is discussion so it shouldn't be so bad. but i'm still worried sometimes the ta randomly calls on people to answer questions which isn't good when i'm totally clueless. its embarrassing. but i guess i'm not the only one. some people didn't know the answers either. the only thing is that in the class there's all these engineering majors completely engrossed in calculus they seem to understand everything. the class would be tons easier if i knew someone in there to help me. but there is morty. he's in a diff class but he says he'll help me. he's so freaking nice. he helps out a lot and hangs out with me even though i can be boring haha. i think he feels bad for me because i'm not adjusting as well as him to college. he's having like the time of his life . so many friends and places to go. i should keep my self busy so i won't get so lonely. i'm joining clubs and stuff but that makes me nervous. i want to run for office but its so scary for some reason. i have second thoughts about everything i have no idea why. i wonder where my roommate went. she works out everyday. its inspiring i should too. i'll go to the gym. haha i'll try who knows if i actually will. i went once and really liked it but i just have to find time. it seems like i have boatloads of work. but college is good. i'll get through it. i just don't know why people say its the best time of their lives. so far it just seems alright. who knows i still have at least 4 years . i'm so sleepy. 5 more minutes of this and then calculus. no time to sleep. ooh i need to watch rnc tonight. i missed last night but laura bush was there. it might of been interesting even though i'm not much for republicans. everything lately is so political. its funny. in every class discussion there is some mention of elections. like in psychology the polls were really interesting. how people afraid of death are more likely to vote for bush. who knows if its actually true but i think there's some validity to it. sigh. i'm going home this weekend. i'm excited. i'm getting a ride from a stranger kind of so its weird. haha that's what's cool about being indian. parents can always find some other indian kid to drive you home. oh well. i'm so tired there's only 2 minutes to go. this was actually cool and stress relieving. you know when you have so much on your mind its good to let it out. oooh asthma just imed me. i haven't talked to her in a while. damn she hangs out with matt clark now. i find that to be so freaking funny. who would of thought? anyways man all i can think about is sleeping and dreaming haha i like dreaming lately i have weird dreams last time i had this nightmare ,0
"this the third time that i am typing this thing. i am so frustrated. every time i get close to the 20 minutes i get cut off. there is a party i want to go to now i am here stuck here spending an hour doing this thing. i don't know what to type because i am tired of staring at this screen. it seems as if in the past two weeks  i have had no time to myself. between pledgship, school, and studying, i have no time. the only time i spend in my room, is done sleeping. i am just going to describe what is going on in sportscenter because i haven't watched it in about a week. chris berman is talking about the upcoming pro football games this weekend. i used to idolize berman. i also liked dick vitale. i was so obsessed that i wrote him a letter. a few weeks later i got a copy of his book with a personalized note on the inside. i am halfway done!   i am starting to calm down. i have never been to hot-headed. i try to keep a level head all the time. the only time i really cut loose is when i am in a competition that i feel i can win. this may not be very often but when it does happen i thrive on the situation. only eight minutes left. i really respect pudge rodriguez. he is the catcher for the rangers, my hometown team. i also like ken griffey jr, he seems like a team player that gives his all every game. mo vaughn is a very large man, he won't win any stolen bases titles anytime. only five minutes left. i like the expos and pirates, just because every year they are competitive even though they have no money to win with. they are building their team through the farm systems, which is how it should be done. i hope to get good grades. i wish this assignment was over. i love college football. i loved to play football but i never was big enough of fast enough to play up to the level i wanted to . i hate danny  schayes. his dad was a great basketball player. one minute left!!  my favorite team is the cowboys. i love going to the games and cheering them on to victory. i think my time is up so i will write later!  the simpsons is the best show on tv by the way. and caddyshack is the bast movie ever!

"ok, twenty minutes has started. well, i feel like i'm trying to keep up with everything, hoping i don't forget some meeting or instruction session i was supposed to go to. i'm thinking i really like ut so far and i feel i'm where i need to be. i miss my puppy, he's the cutest dalmatian in the worldi named him tex. he's my little childi taught him how to give me five! i wish i could go see some of my brother and sister's games, i'm sure they are kicking some butt. i've been thinking about the long distance relationship i'm in, and wondering if maybe i would like to date other people. i mean, he's already been to college, and had his fun, so i think i would like to just date people, but how do you say that to someone? oh well, he's in hawaii for two weeks, so whatever happens while he's outside of the continental u. s. doesn't count, right? just kidding. i'm glad that i came to austin, i get to see my grandmother a lot, and we've always been close, so that's good. i'm surprised that my roommate and i are getting along so well. we've known each other for a long time, and i had anticipated some problems, but so far we are just peachy. i have a feeling or two to share i hate linguistics! i was worried about taking my spanish class because it's upper division, and it has been awhile since i was as sharp with it as when i took the ap test, but i'm loving it. glad i've been working out lately i love that feeling. this is the first year i will not be playing competitive volleyball, and i am definitely suffering from withdrawals. kind of makes me wish i had gone somewhere small to play. when i look at it though, i think i made the right decision. even though my parents thought my room was disgustingly little, i am really liking dorm life. this is cool. i want an apartment next year so i can bring lil tex down with me. speaking of feelings, i hate the phrase """"is it hot enough for ya?"""" if someone says that to me one more time whoops, i guess this isn't a pet peeve writing assignment. the sensations that i have been feeling lately are sensations of extreme heat whenever i step outside! i loved this country place we went to the other night, even though it was far from country. twostepping reminds me of my ex who is still calling. i plan to work out at least 4 times a week now, i'm just so sick of being the group fatty. my friend and i were talking about how we don't have any ugly friends, which i guess is good and bad. good because, i guess being cute always is, and bad, because that means lots of competition! :) i just don't want to be the biggest one anymore. that whole last tangent makes no sense to me, so i'm sure if you choose to read this line, it will make none to you either. well, my 20's up! hope it was good reading!

"how revealing am i supposed to be in this assignment? i can never track my thoughts. they always flit around. i am trying to think of something brilliant to write so i won't appear to be a complete imbecile. i just checked the time and just realized how difficult third is going to be. what am i thinking. i think i need to do well in college. is my studying enough? i mean really. i am not studying as much as you hear is recommended but i feel as if i have a reasonable grasp on what i am learning. how much of an expert am i supposed to leave each class. chemistry is going to kick my ass. i need to try harder. why can't i get it. my sat scores are so high but i can't imagine why. i'm supposed to be smarter. smarter than i am. smarter than your average joe. when i talk i am impressive. people applaud me and remark about me as if i'm brilliant. i'm not. i'm just good at bullshit. i think i want to marry my boyfriend. he doesn't treat me well. but i am a bitch sometimes and not a very good person. does that justify the way he treats me? i cannot afford to think about him all the time. he will cause me to fail. or so my mom says. the minute i think of her saying not to think about him i do. how can i not. i didn't do this on my word processor first. i mean, what is the point of writing this so freshly and giving you all this insight if i just decide to edit it later and erase my imperfections. my typos are me. i make mistakes. i misspell. rarely of course. i am thinking nothing right now. i wonder if other people do that. think of nothing. i think of a blank canvas. is that nothing? i guess not but i believe you can understand what i am trying to say. you know, every single night that we have been here my boyfriend and i have spent together? my bed is too small. i want to sleep next to him more than anything but it is just so uncomfortable. you can't have your cake and eat it too. hmmmm. i am so deliciously tired right now. you know the kind of tired where you are cold and you know that nothing on the planet would feel as good as your comforter. will is annoying me. he has this dumb ass book he will not put down. i hate competing for his attention. asshole. oh yeah will is my boyfriend. i forgot to mention my honey's name. back to my tired. i just want to stretch out lazily in my bed. it is not really body fatigue. i just want to to go into my cocoon. something nonacademic. something cozy. it is mental and social fatigue which i suffer from. six more minutes. i need to study more and remember how to do empirical stoichiometry. oh yeah. you can bet i checked the spelling on that one. today i was called the """"s"""" word by another black person. sellout. will is white. black people hate that. do you know that in my entire life i have never had a true black friend. the black girls seem to hate me. they think that i am a snob. the black guys listen to the black girls. and i listen to my heart. i love will. i worry about him. being with a black girl makes him lack in the eyes of many. it makes him black and he does not get that yet. when he loses his first opportunity, or does not get that promotion he will. then he will leave me. it's all a matter of time. why would someone like him want someone like me. why would someone like me want someone like him. he does not realize that failure in life is not an option with me. guess what its' been? 20 minutes.

"today was a very long and exhausting day. i began by waking up at 8:15, after only 6 hours of sleep, to go to a 9:00 art history discussion lab at the museum. it actually crossed my mind to skip class and then go back to sleep, that way i wouldn't be as tired as i am right now. but instead i decided to go ahead and go to class, otherwise i would just fall behind and not know what happend. personaly, i am not one to really like getting behind, so i think that i made the right decision, granted i may be tired right now, i know my decision to go to class will pay off in the long run. as my day continued, i went to the actual class lecture for  art history. it was somewhat interesting, although i found it a little difficult to consentrate. i guess that may be because i did not catch up on my reading that i was supposed to have completed by today. obviously i am paying for the ocnsequenses of not keeping up with the outside responsibilities. futhur in the day, i went to the dentist to get a filling,  which was not fun!  the right side of my mouth was numb for about 4 hours. that may not sound like too long, but in reality, when your mouth is numb and you can't talk well, and you can't eat or drink anything because you will spill it, it is a long time. then i proceeded to go to a meeting. i had previously told my room mate that she was able to use my computer while i was gone. this kind of bothered me just because i payed for this computer and i could have just relied on her supplying the computer and used hers. i just don't really think that that is fair. then what really irritated me, which doesn't happen too ofter, is that when i came back from the meeting, the stuff that was in my chair that she sat in was thrown all on the floor. my brand new shirts that are not even two days old, my purse, and my shorts, were all on the ground. now it is one hting to use something of someones and put everything back where you found it, but to be so inconsiderate as to not put things back in it's place is rude. i was quite mad, so instead of confronting her, i just left and went to get tcby and to watch tv with my sister. i guess you could say that i did it to get out of confronting her and to also blow some steem off. oh well, what's done is done, but next time i think that i just might have to say something to her(if i let her use my computer next time). well, that was pretty much my day, and now i am just trying to get caught up with all of my responsibilities and homework, which is making me stressful. i know that i will be relieved when i finish it all, though.

"i don't really understand. i am supposed to track my thoughts and feelings?  write about anything as long as it is for twenty minutes?  ok. i kind of miss my old life at home, but i was so looking forward to moving on to other things. i have a friend that just went into the army last month and i will never see him again. other friends have gone off to college and moved away. life is starting to change a great deal. i work for a company called vector selling cutco, or at least i did this summer, and we had conventions every now and then. i would always make friends from around the country, but end up never seeing them again. people don't keep in touch with each other like they should. i try to stay in touch with my friends and people that i meet. it is often difficult, though. i don't know. i am really thirsty right now. i was thinking of going up to my room first to get a drink, but i didn't figure they would let you bring drinks in here, and i didn't want to wait to get this done. i have waited long enough. i need to stop putting things off. i need to get things done. i guess it is just lack of motivation. well that and lack of a computer. this is the first time i have been in the computer lab here at jester. i am really thirsty and my throat is dry. i need to get this e-mail thing worked out. i haven't tried to use it yet. i might do that when i am finished with this. i wish that things could be the way they were, but then i don't. you know how sometimes something happens and you just want to freeze that moment in time and never leave. that has happened to me recently. not since i have been at ut, but before, when i was with my friends. i like to spend time with my friends because they make me feel comfortable. i like to be around them because it is just very uplifting. my arm is starting to get tired because i don't have the right kind of writing area. it is uncomfortable in here. i need to go get a drink, but i still have a lot of time to keep writing, so i won't. i wish i had a computer so i could get things done on my own time. life would be a whole lot easier, i think. i think i should go home and see my dog before the neighbors try to steal him again. if i don't pay enough attention to him he goes to stay at the neighbors house. they decided one day that they liked him and they were just going to keep him. they tried to give me an ultimatum (i don't know how to spell that word). they said that if i didn't give them the dog, then they did not want him at their house anymore, but if i didn't want the dog they would take him. the whole situation didn't make any sense to me, but what do i know. i don't think that they had the right to ask for my dog. he is my dog. whatever. needless to say, i didn't give them the dog, but i got him fixed and had to tie him up for a while. he eventually learned that he had to stay at home, or at least near our house if he didn't want to be tied up. it rained yesterday for the first time in a long while. it didn't rain much, though. i missed most of the lightning the other night because i don't have a real window in my room. it is just like a quarter of a window and it gives me the feeling that i am in a dungeon. i hate my room. i wanted to get a plant, but then i realized that there wouldn't be enough light to keep it alive, so i axed that idea. i wish there would be a big storm because i like to watch the storms. the lightning, thunder, rain, and winds are really relaxing. my parents are building a house, but it is taking them forever. anyway, you can sit on the back porch of the house and watch the rain. it is very nice. my friends kate, abby, and alana are at southwest and i was just thinking about kate's yard and how nice it is. i bet it is really nice out there after it rains. the other night i watched a meteor shower and that was really beautiful. i like to look at the stars, but i dropped astronomy because everyone said that it was really hard and that all it was a lot of math like distances to stars. i didn't feel like taking a math class so now i am taking physical anthropology. i don't know. my twenty minutes is up now so i am going to quit writing and submit this because i am sure it is really boring anyway. i feel sorry for whoever has to read this. my wrist hurts. ha.

"     well, ut seems to be a very confortable place. i like my classes fairly well. claculus and physics will probably be the most difficult. chemistry seems like it will be very easy. . and psycology. well psycology looks to be very interesting. i talked to my sister last night. she graduated from ut with a degree in psycology. all she told me was,   don't get hooked. we don't need two psycology degrees in the family. and at least someone's got to make the money.   that someone being me. i really love my sister. she is a very unique person. her life has been a blast. she likes to go places and have fun. . she's got a hugh fun-excited spirit. she's been to costa rica. . and now she lives in chicago. i almost went skydiving with her a couple weeks back when i visited, but the weather got real bad the day we were going to jump. i think it will take me a litle while to totally accustom myself to austin. it's hard leaving the people i love. . my family and my girlfriend. i am in a very serious relationship. we've been together fro almost a year now. . and i think that we're going to make it through all this time apart and end up very happy together. man this is taking a long time. i miss my brother. he is a marine. he joined the reserves back in january of 2001. last january he got a call saying his unit was being activated and he would have to leave for cuba in two days. so mid january of this year he and one of his good high school friends who just so happened to end up in the same unit drove down to houston. from houston they were sent to san antonio for some training. they stayed there for a couple weeks, then were sent to the east coast. . somewhere near the cheasapeake bay area and had to go through a few months of training. they did some pretty neat stuff like riot training and stuff like that. he was able to to call us every now and then, and it was good to hear from him. then after he was done with his training he was finally sent to guantonimo bay cuba. there he and his unit were stationed for patrol duty. . basically they drive around the outer wall and patrol it. since he has been there he really hasn't had much time to talk to us. he did take his laptop so he can get on the internet to e-mail, but he isn't given much time to do that. every now and then he gave us a call. he called the day of graduation to see how i was doing. i really wish he could have been there to see me give my speach. it was just not the same without him. he acctually called me here the other day. at about 12:30 at night. so i didn't want to talk long cause it was keeping my roommate up. but he comes home in november. . so it won't be ong before i see himn again. when he gets back my sister is coming down from chicago to pick him up. . then they are coming over to austin to see me. . and we're all going to go skydiving!  i can't wait. i'm going back home this weekend. i leave tommorow right after my last class. i'll get to lufkin around 7:30 in time to see the high school football game. we won state last year. but my girlfriend is in the drill team. . so i'll get to see her perform, i miss her a lot. time is almost over. i've got a little moer homeowrk till i can get to work on a project i've been planning. i'm making my girlfriend a cd. . well actually two cd's. i think she will like them. it felt really good to sleep in a little today. thursdays are the only day i don't have an 8:00 class!  so i like thursday. well. . time is running down. . only a few seconds left. . so i'll say adeu. . till we meet agian.

"the first thought that comes to my mind right now is about two of my little sisters. they are ages 4 and 7. i can't help but worry about them atleast five times a day. they live with my mother who is not exactly the world's best role model. i feel bad saying this, but it is true. she is not very strict, and it is easy to get away with the things that she says not to do. when i used to live with her i took advantage of this. i made terrible grades, lied all the time, sometimes for no apparant reason, and i did not take care of myself. thank god i got out of that situation. i moved in with my father and my former stepmother. they got me out of my bad habits for the most part and without them i would never be sitting at this computer doing an assignment for a college course. even after my dad and stepmom got divorced i still lived with her, i am so thankful that she has been here for me all these years. getting back to my sisters, i am afraid that they will fall into the same habits i did and they are not as lucky as i was to have my stepmom. i can see them in the future missing out on so many opportunities because my mom won't keep them in line. i hope that i can be a positive influence on them, but it will be hard because i only get to see them about once a month. they are beautiful children with great personalities. unfortunately regina the 7 year old has already had troubles in school. i know this is not my mother's fault, because it seems as though she has some type of learning disability, but at the same time my mother doesn't spend any extra time working with her. andrea the 4 year old is absolutely brilliant, i don't think she will have any problems in school unless she falls into the same pattern i did of lying and not doing her school work. i would never want to see my sisters move in with there dad though, because i am afraid that would make my mother feel as though she were a failure. i cannot imagine having three children and then having all of them raised elsewhere. i know she loves all three of us, and we are her life, and i love my mother very much also, but i just wish she would make more of an effort to make better lives for them. it would be a big help if she would just grow up a little bit, her mother still runs her life, and she cannot make decisions by herself. overall she needs to work on herself first and then benefit the children from that.

"     gregory benjamin's writhing assingment, september 11, 2001. today was a decent day, architeture studio was great, and interesting, although we got a major project due for friday. everyone in our studio is freaking out over it, but i don't think it would be so bad. in the meantime, i still to to catch up on some reading for my architecture and society class, even though the book is dreadfully boring. i do not want to read it! it is simply boring! blah, blah, blah, building, blah blah blah. i am an architecture major, and this book is boring, that should say something. i wish we could just hurry up and read the little black book, thats thermal delight in architecture that is. it is way more interesting, and talks about actual concepts rather than just buildings in general like some books. . uhhhhh (experiencing architecture). boring!. on thursday, i have visual communication, a class that basicly teaches us how to draw. the proffesor there is annoying sometimes, since he thinks he knows everything and he does not. i honestly think he is teaching for an ego trip, he continues to put down many of the students, he is lucky he hasn't crossed pathes with me because i will at least defend myself. anyways, i am majoring in somehing i love to do, so i guess i can trudge though the school. some of my business friends may make fun of me for that reason, but at least i won't be pulling my hair out because my employes are idiots! (plus, i won't be working at wal-mart, the consumer of business). speaking of stuff i love to do, i love music! i really had a hard decision deciding on rather majoring in music or architecture. . . but since i have been wanting to do architecture since i was like, four, i choose it. . (it all started with legos). . .  on a diffrent note, this page is buggy because when you press enter, then backspace, it returns to the previous page, so when you press forward, it returns to this page, except the counter reset!!! nooooo! there goes five minutes of typing!!! luckily, i am a very patient person :) &lt;----not very formal, hope this isn't read. (yeah right, out of a class of 500? please, i wa sbearly noticed in my high school class of 680, and i knew people there. speaking of people from high scool, one of them is in this class. say hello to jeff prudon everyone! (this is ment to be read in front of class, but since it probably won't, i might as well try to call him out) you get your own personl shout out jeff! from the proffesor too! (or whoever is reading). jeff is a business major, and tries to brag that he will make more money than me. . . but all i say is i love what i do and, you won't be saying that when you are ready to build your dream house. . and again, i won't be having a heartattack because my employes are lazy and stupid, because we work in a group. not a hiearchy. &lt;---seems to be spelled wrong. i can  t spell worth crap&gt; the computer has spoiled me with spell check, and grammar check. darn microsoft, just trying to make us all more stupid over a period of time, so we are just brainwashed into buying only thier products!

(spelling? was something wrong?) well. if it wasnt for that back bug earlier, i would have benn finished by now, but i still have 4 minutes left! hey, maybe that was my bad luck! now my computer won;'t crash because that was bad enough! muhhahahahaah!!!!!!! ok. . now this is where i really just waste time typing, because i have nothing to type about any more. i guess, i could just recopy my notes i took in your class how aboutt hat! it would be similar to studying! hmmm. . zarconic effect-willingness to finish something. . . zzzzzzz. . . whoops! sorry about that. fell asleep for a second. . actually i didn't. i find your class interesting and entertaining, i don't go asleep in it, i fall asleep in arch&soc. the chairs are so comfortable, and he shows slides everyday, so he always turn off the lights. . recipe for sleep! now my 20min are up, and i have to sleep myself!

the one thing that i miss here at school is my drums. i couldn't bring them with me to college because there is no where to put them. i used to play in a band and people used to tell me that i was really good but then i stopped playing and i got worse. when they were always there for me to play i never wanted to but now i wish i could play them more than anything. my best friend is a drummer but he always kept on practicing and he got really good. so good that now he is moving to maryland to join a band. the band he is joining is pretty successful death metal band and they have two albums. i miss my friend and i hope that he is doing alright up there. he left all of his friends and family back in san antonio and he doesn't know anyone in maryland except for his band members and he really doesn't know them too well. i wish i could go up and see him and watch his band play since i am a big fan of death metal music. i listen to all types of music but death metal is definitely one of my favorites. i don't like it when people talk bad about death metal when they don't even know anything about it. i want death metal artists to be able to someday get rich off there music like all of the other pop artists. because the talent that comes along with death metal music is remarkable.  ,0
"i don't know what i'm doing tonight. there's a cory morrow concert at the midnight rodeo place on ben white. i have no idea how i would get there. maybe i could get my ex-girlfriend to take me, but that'd be pretty weird. i was just looking online and saw that some ou'ut tickets are going for like $2000. i don't know what people were thinking when they didn't get reserved season football tickets. i just had to go up to the line once and got all my tickets for the entire season, including the ou'ut game. pretty cool. ya, mike's getting upset at me cause i'm not going to college station this weekend. instead, i'm going to go see jerry jeff walker in gruene on saturday. god, i hate this nashville country thing. i got to change the radio station. it's upsetting. i wonder where my roomate houston is. he was supposed to be back around 4:30 and he still hasn't showed up. oh well. i got all of my calculus homework except for like 2 problems done, so that's pretty cool. i wish he would clean his side of the room a little more. i want to go play soccer tonight at clark field, but they're like watching american pie 2 tonight. that's really cool. oh well. haha, it's only been four minutes? this is going to take forever. i can't wait to go back to st. joe for homecoming. i want to go to the alumni party before the game. supposedly, it's pretty fun. they don't really mind at all if you're underage. haha. my leg is hurting because i'm pressing it up against the table while i write. what other homework do i have to do tonight? hm. . . oh, i have to print out some spanish worksheets. my computer keeps humming at odd intervals. i wonder what's going on there. i can't find a decent radio station that i can recieve in my dorm. i'm going to put some music from kazaa on. haha, just kidding. travis tritt- it's a great day to be alive just came on. haha. i hope ya'll don't really care about grammar and all that because i'm just trying to write quickly without caring about that kind of stuff. this song reminds me of garner state park. that was a blast. they have these dances every night and most people at the park go there. it's awesome. my buddies and i met all these cute girls from baytown, or something like that. all i know is that i want to go to baytown sometime! haha. my bed isn't too comfy. it could be a lot nicer. i need to fix that somehow. great, this song is ending. i wonder what's next. haha, a little kazaa is next. you ever listened to   me and billy the kid   by pat green? let me tell ya, it's a good song. i wish i could play the fiddle that well. i need to sign up for a music course next semester on how to play the fiddle . that'd be cool. i suck at it now, but being good at it wouldn't be bad. haha. only halfway done. i wonder how much people write in these things. i bet reading them is pretty darn interesting. haha i held back with the   darn   right there. haha. anyways, i don't want to do calculus. the fiddle sounds really cool in this song. here's the solo. it soudns awesome. seriously, download the song and listen to the solo. you'll like it. . . if you're a texan. . haha. i hate antonian high school. my buddy sent me a link to a webpage of theirs, and they were all proud of having made it to the state semis in baseball. funny thing is, they lost in the first round of playoffs. we had the same records last year (need to change song again) but they went to playoffs because they had a better head to head record. we lost to them both times in the bottom of the last inning. you have no idea how upset we were. a freaking junior dropped a fly ball in the outfield to give them the tying run. i'm still pissed about that, but oh well. this song is awesome. southbound 35 by pat green. it talks about coming back to texas when he's leaving in kansas. it's pretty cool. so what else. . i don't know how i'm getting to the ou game. i got to find a ride, maybe with amy. homework is no fun. haha. i love it when they mention austin in songs. it's pretty cool. i have to clean my room. i need to call whats that place. midnight rodeo and ask about the cover and when cory goes on stage. hope it's not much. college is quite expensive man. i love this part. ya. . we were. soutbound 35!. . haha. new song coming. . i feel like a little palo alto, naked sorority girls. the lyrics in that one are pretty funny. a sigma chi guy showed me this song during rush week. they're too expenisve. i think delta sig is the way to go. they're cool. this song has an awesome beat. haha almost done. this actually went by pretty fast. what to do after? maybe find someone who knows how to do those calculus problems. but when it comes to love, its all greek to me! haha. . . i love this song. well this has been fun. adios till next time.

"well, i finally made it to the computer lab. of course i waited until the last minute. now that i figured out how to get in here it won't be so hard tomorrow. i hope i can get it done tomorrow by 5 because i only have an hour between classes. i am so happy that i got out of my class early today. it gives me time to study other things. i think i did fairly well on my quiz but who knows. i should have gone to work today. i feel a little guilty for leaving when i did, but i show up and they aren't even there. what am i supposed to do, just stand out in the hall like an idiot?  this job is a waste of my time. they never have anything for me to do anyway. i wish i could quit, but i can't because mom is friends with linda and i need the money. especially now because of the car situation. i swear don is just being a big baby about the whole thing. i hope i'm not in a bad mood this weekend. it will be nice to just relax without having to go out. i hope my dinner turns out ok. wally might be sorry he asked me to cook for him. i need to call him tonight for his birthday. i hope the package he got was either from his mom or dad. i can't believe he didn't get a card from either of them last year. i know he was upset about that, but of course he would never admit that to me. it's too bad sometimes that i can't talk to him about everything. like last night, i know he didn't know what to say when i called, but i just kept thinking that if i had been talking to rica or renee they would know how to handle the situation better. but what can i expect, he's just a guy. he's told me before that he doesn't handle the mushy stuff very well. at least he listens to me. i'm glad i had the chance to talk to genia yesterday. i really do feel bad about not visiting her, but i knew it was best for everyone if we didn't see her. at least she doesn't live here anymore. i think that would be a bad situation. i really hope she gets over him soon. she's been sad too long, and it's just not doing her any good. i've completely run out of things to say, and that doesn't happen to me very often. unfortunately it's happening more often. i really love it here at ut, but it is incredibly lonely. i see thousands of people everyday, but i'm still lonely. i guess that's why i'm on the phone for so long every night. i need to feel connected to my friends even if i don't see them as much as i used to. unfortunately, i'm on the phone so much that i don't get much studying done. it's alot different than high school. i never had to study in high school. now i'm so behind, and i don't know if i'll ever get caught up. i guess when i'm done with this i'll go study until my next class, which happens to be psychology. i thought this was supposed to be a lesson in stress relief. well, this assignment has given me nothing but a headache. speaking of headaches i can't seem to get rid of mine. it's either stress or allergies. either way i'm suffering. well, i'm finally done so i guess this is it.

"well, sitting here doing this assignment at 10:55 a. m. and my lazy butt just woke up. i can't believe that i wake up so late nowadays. i remember my freshman year where i slept a few hours a night and got by fine. i'm feeling a little bad about myself for not working out this morning like i wanted too. if i could just get up when i wanted to then there would be not problem. but no, i have to stay in bed until the last possible second before class. on wed. i have my first class at noon, and i was late. how pathetic is that?  how can i not get up before the sun has reached its peak position over the city?  typing this is making my forearm hurt a little. i first noticed that when i was shooting a basketball yesterday. i think i might have pulled something lifting weights the other day and at least worked something that i don't usually work out so it hurts a little. is strange, i am supposed to be sitting here thinking of stuff and my mind blanks out, but when i am supposed to be concentrating, my mind decided that then is the appropriate time to start racing with ideas and contemplations not associated at all with what i am doing. i actually like this assignment, its kind of nice to just sight down and write down what i am thinking about. i tried to start a journal once but to no avail. i am not a person of habit. i cannot just dedicate myself to something at a certain time everyday or week whenever unless it is something that i have to do, such as class, or a job if i ever find one. i felt really disappointed that i could not find a job this summer. why was i having such a hard time?  i have problems with things like that, i hate doing the first part of something, such as actually finding the job or deciding on a career. that's one of the reasons i am taking this class as a junior, because i don't know what else to take. i can't decide what i want to do for the rest of my life. i would be so much easier if i had someone say you are going to be a business man or a teacher, take these classes, and don't suck it up like you have been doing for the first two years of your college career"""". and i would be like """"ok, fine, i can do that"""" and then i would do it, but probably not to the full extent of my ability. i have a hard time doing things to hardcore for an extended amount of time. i guess everyone is like that but even things i like to do, after time i start slacking, such as car audio fabrication. i like to build things out of fiberglass and my last project really sucked it up. i guess it was a learning experience but after a few days of working on it i got dismayed because it didn't look as good as i had hoped it would and finally said """"the hell with it"""" and just finished it. now i am ready to chunk it and start anew. but i like building things, so that my be the reason too.

"i'm missing my friends as i always do when we're not together. i sort of wish i would have gone to school with my best friend eliza. i had too much fun this summer and now i'm just really bored with austin. even so my classes seem interesting enough. i'm glad i switched majors. my family got a puppy. i told them they should name it bevo, but i think that that would make my aggie sister not to happy. i can't wait for my friends to visit me in october. real stupid, huh. i'm all looking forward to two months from now. i feel kind of bad though, because i think troy likes me too much and i'm just not interested. i really hope mandy doesn't get mad at me if i hurt his feelings. like she is one to judge. i'm really looking forward to going jetskiing, but i really want to go dancing. i can't wait to go to clubbing. i hope lisa calls me today. she's being a real butthead. well i guess i understand. we're all having money troubles. i hope i find a job. it's really going to suck if i don't. i'm sort of wondering if someone is going to read this. i really hope not cause i think i sound kind of stupid. i am sort of stupid, but that doesn't mean everyone should know. i hope danny writes to me soon. i'm going to feel really dorky if i write to him and he never writes back. bambino. i think i'm going to play a trick on bert today. he is such a jerk. i cannot believe that he was so rude to me last year. i really expected a lot more from him. i sort of miss our friendship, but i guess that's how it goes. i really miss eric. i wish it hadn't ended the way it did. i feel like crying now. how is it that you can ever forget someone that you loved so much. it's like he's dead to me now, cause i can never talk to him again. oh well. i know i would hate it if we got back together. i feel like i'm writing in a diary, but i can't say the really juicy stuff. i want to go to six flags. i love amusement park rides. i wish emily had gotten on the rides with me the last time. it was so funny to see her so terrified. i miss gerry. i should write her a note today. i hope she still has email. i'm really going to miss her if i can't find her. gerry is one of the greatest people i know. she is so nonjudgmental. i wish i could see her again. i have to stop procrastinating. i don't know what else to write . . ok  i hope lisa comes to pick me up soon. i would really like to see her. i am so pathetic. here it's only been a week and a half and i'm already wanting to see my friends again. i was going to write something, but i forgot. damn it i hate it when that happens. i hope i make some more friends this year. people who like to do stuff, like emma. i can't believe she actually took me to mexico whenever i wanted to go. it's to bad they grounded her at the end of the summer. that' all folks!

"life as a college student is not quite like how i had expected. when i was a senior in high school, i thought i was going to be a studious student having a lot fun. but two weeks into college and i'm already slacking off. most freshman who start off college don't really know what's going on, but i guess you can say that i had an early start. this was because my older sister, lisa, also attends ut. with this factor, i quickly started to hang out with my sisters friends and began slacking off. so what i am saying is that, if i didn't have someone that knew what was up, than i would probably be having an easier time staying on track. maybe its just me, but that is how i feel. but i am having a lot of fun, i guess you can say. i met a few people from orientation. they are the people that i am usually with. but i am having a hard time making friends in my classes. it might be because i'm always late to class and i never get a chance to settle down before class starts, probably. well, i'm hoping to make some really good friends here. isn't there a saying that a person makes most of their """"life long"""" friends in college? i don't know. i don't even know why i am talking about my personal life for a homework assignment. i don't know if i am even doing it correctly. i guess that i will find out when i get my grade for it. its been fourteen minutes and i am already running out of things to say. okay, i'm going to return to what i was talking about in the beginning, school life. i really feel that i need to get myself prioritized. i need to catch up with all my work and get ready for my up coming tests. i really don't know what else to write and i think this is about 20 minutes, so that it.

"twenty minutes seems like a very long time to have to write about what i am thinking in my conscience. i just got a letter from my aunt. she was writing to see if i was ok and whether or not i like ut. so far i do like ut. i just wish that i had the social skills to make friends easier. i am not a very out-going person and it takes me long periods of time to become good friends with people. i am very picky about the type of people i hang out with. i especially dislike snobby people. i realize people are all equal and that under no circumstances should anyone believe they are better then someone else. although sometimes i do feel i am smarter than other students here at ut. everyone always tells me i have a huge amount of potential, but that i need to motivate myself to use my potential. sometimes i feel very lonely. i am an only child and my parents divorced when i was five. i have never really had a real relationship. i want so bad to have someone in my life that will stand to hang out with me twenty-four hours a day. this wish makes me seem very needy and i hate to think that i am a needy person. for some reason i think being needy makes me weak. oh, well, on to something else, this so far hasn't been very fun. i am not sure what i want to do with my future. i am undeclared in the college of natural sciences. undeclared could be used to describe my entire life. i try, subconsciensly to avoid any huge decisions. i sometimes think that i want to be a psychiatrist. however, this is for selfish reasons. i believe that i am self-sufficient. i don't want to let someone else fix my problems. if i became a psychiatrist then i would be able to analyze myself and determine why i am screwed up. at the top of this assignment it said not to worry about spelling. i guess it's the perfectionist in me, but there is no way i could leave behind a trail of mispelled words. i realize though that there are some mispelled words in this paragraph though. i wonder if someone is actually going to read this. i keep having to look over my shoulder. i am worried that my roomate is going to read this and think i am some kind of weirdo. is weirdo actually a word?  for some reason i don't think it is. weirdo makes me think of gonzo from the muppet babies, also that blue guy from seasame street. i haven't watched those shows in years. it's funny what people think of sometimes. actually time is slipping by pretty fast. ummm. i can't think of anything to write. my schedule is so screwy. i have four classes on m, w, f, and then one on t,th. it gives me plenty of time to work on homework or prepare for classes though. my mom is susposed to get on instant messenger tonight so we can chat. i miss her and my best friend a lot. my dad is an asshole. can we curse on this assignment?  i was never able to before. college is so different, people actually treat us like adults. i want to get an apartment. i don't like living in the dorm. not enough personal space. i also want a dog. my favorite breed of dog is the chow-chow. however everyone always tells me they are very protective of their owners and can become aggressive towards strangers. i want two so that they can keep each other company while i am at school. that is a dream though. i have to decide whether or not i want to get my car fixed or sell it. i am leaning towards getting it fixed because it is a good car, nissan stanza, and there is no way i can buy a new car. the only problem is that it is an '87. that is really old compared to all my friends cars. my best friend drives a '99 tahoe. lots of people call him spoiled, but i don't think so. well time is up, i'm not sure i got the point of this exercise though!

"i need to learn better time management skills. i'm so glad that i can finally access all those crazy sites and forums in rhetoric. oh wow! what's up with that teacher? i do feel sorry for her though. i know what's it like not to be able to do all that technical computer stuff. afterall, i was only on the computer last night for four hours. and i can't believe i allowed myself to sleep for over an hour and a half this morning! but you know what? i figured out that i can get a lot of work done as long as i do it outside of my dorm room. i also figured out why people say   silence is golden.  (though personally, i don't mind a little noise every now and then. ) oh my gosh! i totally found a gift from god today! i was sitting in the study lounge in jester only to stumble upon a study group for 408k. and it was definitely a blessing to finally get into teranchi's class. i can't believe theresa and my new friends are in there. though the day has seemed slow, that was such a delight. now i can email theresa or maybe call up katherine. (i talked to katherine today infront of jesta pizza and she's taking 408k too. ) i got the phone numbers of two of the girls in the study group and both said they'd be more than welcome to help me with my 408k homework. the only thing i'm not quite sure if it's a plus or not would be the fact that coco and rubes are in this new class as well. i'm not sure if i'm at a stage where i could answer questions as i'm trying to learn them myself. and though it sounds kind of bad, i really need to get an 'a' in 408k. maybe i can review it this weekend and then i might be able to help them next week. oh wow, next week! i have tests coming out of nowhere! but today was refreshing considering the fact that i'm actually caught up on almost all of my classes. if i can do that in one day. time management here i come! it's pretty pathetic, the little that make you excited. well once i'm done with this maybe i'll have a better feeling about the rest of my classes because that's one more assignment down. oh yeah, uh huh! i kind of wish i was a speed reader. i wonder if i'd actually get to party a lot more. dude, screw the parties me and henna are going to build a fort. how cool is that? that's just too cool! oh yeah, we're going to take the pillows from all our friends and were going to throw blankets over them and   pow   there's your fort. oh and we're going to watch movies in it too! oh yeah, people that hear about this one. jealous.

"i've never really thought about what i'm thinking before, there seems to be someone in the net room making alot of racket. that's ok though because this is a dorm. they are talking now, wait i can't here them anymore, wait they just started talking again. i wonder what they are talkig about, probably something unimportant. i really need to find out where the fine arts library is so i can do this gay reading list. i don't even have a clear understanding of what i'm supposed to do. i assume i just have to look at some art and write down my feelings about it or something. it is really annoying becuase the class is already 4 hours long. there should not be any outside work, but i guess it's not too hard, and if there are not any set boundaries there isn't any set grading material, this means that it is basically completion, much like this assignment. i really want to go to the texas ski ranch tommorrow but i can't find anyone to go and it is like an hour away and it will probably take longer because of traffic because the only time i could leave would be around 5:30. i hope they have put up some pimp sliders and kickers out there. if anyone reads this and you wakeboard'wakeskate and you want to go ride behind a pimp ass supra launch ssv and your willing to pay gas money contact me. because i'm always looking for other riders and other people to pay gas money except myself. my roomate is sleeping right now. i can't decide if i like him or not. i don't dislike him, but i can't imagine myself being a really good friend of his. it seem our only link is that we are roomates. he seem like a little bit of a jesus freak and a dork. that would suck if he was reading this right now, it's ok, he's not. but you know how some people you just feel that you have a connection with them, that you can talk to them. you know that when your aroud them you feel comfortable. you can never tell that when you just look at a person. it seems to be the strangest people that are these people that you seem to share a special bond with, that you feel completly comfortable with. you feel you can be yourself, act stupid, laugh, you become a different person when you are around those people. i only noticed that fact this year. this year has been a real year of self examination and growth for me. i don't think i have grown as much as a thinking human being in this year then any other. i don't know what spurred it, but i think i know. i know i know. it was a girl i just got to know this year, but when i realized how important she was to me and how much i liked her she was taken. in my self pity i couldn't find the strength to tell her how i felt. i think i was scared of losing the friendship we already had. i didn't want our relationship to be strained by the possibility of me having feelings for her but the feelings not being mutual. i should have just told her and gotten it out in the open. she changed my life. i got the idea in my mind that to be with her i would need to be in the same physical shape as her to have any chance of a relatinship. she was the first motivation ever that pushed me to fulfill a long time goal of losing wieght and getting in shape. i still think about her and i know in my heart i will pursue her the next oppurtunity. the weight loss brings to mind another point that i have noticed about people. for as much talk that there is about inner beauty and all that shit, it's bullshit general (bulshi         ",0
"    sleep! that's what i need to do. i stayed up all night writing my freshman seminar paper on bond- born an electric quartet. i asked my roommate that i was going to get some shut eye for about 10 minutes and to wake me up for my class at ten, but she woke me up 40 minutes later. i wasn't late. thank god! i'm really stressed out, i have so many things to do this weekend. why is college so easy yet so hard to manage. management, i believe, is the biggest thing in college. i miss my family so much. i really don't know if i'm doing this right. i'm trying to type so fast that my hands are shaking and i'm pressing the wrong keys. grrr! my roommate is leaving today to see her family. good for her. we were both crying, actually i was the only one come to think of it. she said she never cries even if it is the saddest thing ever. how can you not cry. i guess i'm very emotional and sensitive. i was sick last weekend and when my parents came up to see me they were really worried. i hope they are healthy and son't worry so much. i want to see them and my brothers so bad. i'm done with classes and i'm free!! i love the feeling of writing in streams of consciousness. it is probably one of my favorite past times besides playing and composing music. i really want to be super good on my electric violin. after writing my paper about the electric quartet, i realized that i wanted to be like them. i actually miss my quartet. they all went to the university of chicago and are sophomores there. i'm always the youngest in everything. youngest in my graduating class, among my friens, at my church-- that is youth bible group, and even among the freshmans here at ut. i feel so old yet so young compared to others here. i can't believe that there are 30 maybe even 40 year olds in my calculus class. i was so shocked when several older males came and sat in our lecture. they are older than my professor and ta's. what are they doing here at such a old age, i wonder. did they flunk, not graduate, drop out and then realize many years later that school is the best place to be! i was walking out of pcl after studying late and this homeless guy walks up and asked for money. i ignored him because i was creeped out. it is my belief that if a homeless is not missing any limbs and is perfectly capable to work then he'she should. however, if they are missing an arm or let's say play the saxophone on the street, i would definetly give them some change. i feel that they are doing their best with the disabilities facing them. last night, my roommate came in with her best guy friend, who's bi-sexual, and another guy that i later found was gay. i really don't mind gay guys although i find it sad, i do mind if they are lesbians!! yuck! i'm a strong christian girl so it really is hard for me to cope with such things. i am very conservative and tend to not change my views for anyone unless the provide convincing evidence. i really want to keep writing on and on but i have 2 minutes left. i love to write especially poems. i like being creative and connecting with my inner feelings. i guess it is because i play classical music and only listen to classical music. classical music, i think is the most sensuous, expressive and beautiful form of art every created. i would love to whip out my violin or go to a grand piano and play songs after songs. i better wrap up--oh no--it's almost time for me to go. i'll---phew--the computer is letting me write a little more. whoever is grading this is really going to enjoy reading everyone's writing. well, i got to head off to my biology study group. toodles!

"in phl 304 we've been talking about kant and deintology, which leads me to a question:why am a writing this; is schoolwork a hypothetical or categorical imparitive? do i really care what the about the answer to that question? no. i'm just picking my brain. frustration is undoubtedly a major hinderance to my well being. why didn't the tab button work when i pressed it? heplessness is abundant in my brain when it comes to computers. thinking of the word helpless reminds me of that csn&y song. they're such a great group- but not as great as buffalo springfield- their predecessor. whatever. that's the word that runs through my head most often these days. i really wonder whether it matters what i write in this assignment. who in this beauracracy of a university is actually going to read this? i doubt much if it would matter if i just wrote something like """"i enjoy carrots"""" over and over again. whatever. there's that word again. every time that you ask for more, its the sound that makes the colors go blind, and everything comes in three's, but your face shows 2-lost in a watershed-way out of tune. got that? i doubt it, in fact i doubt you made it this far. lack of patience most likely. patience is a very admirable quality. i wish i had more of it. in fact, ever since i arrived here my patience has been raped, but i'll get more into that in writing assignment #2. believe it or not, its been 20 minutes, and though this """"stream of consciousness"""" seems to be more about this assignment than anything else, i am just articulating what is on my mind. i guess that doesn't really matter if this isn't being graded. since i know no one will read this i may as well confess that my dog, skeezy and my friend chico spend most nights defecating on all the wombats in the toilet, but that doesn't really bother me. what bothers me is that chico also likes to slap a alligators to death with a certain part of his anatomy. this really seems to impress iranian supermodels. go figure.

"i'm in my boyfriends apartment and my friends and i are doing our laundry. i feel very tired since i have an 8:00am class. i've had a pretty good day though, i love ut. my classes seem okay and i'm sure i'll do fine. i don't feel at all homesick, which is good. my parents miss me so much though and i feel bad for that. i'm going home this weekend even though i don't want to, but that's okay. i don't think i'm doing this right. no one will probably ever read this so why should i care. i feel like such a number at this school, but i am determined to change that. i feel like i'm writing in my journal. emily and annie are over here too and they brought their homework. i wish i had brought mine. i am so afraid that i'm going to get behind in my classes and not make good grades. i want a gpa of 3. 5 or better. maybe it was stupid to set a goal that high, but that's good for me because last year i could have done a lot better. i don't regret it though, i had a very nice senior year. this year i want to study very hard though and be able to say i tried my hardest. i also want to get a phd in psychology. i don't know why though because i just want to be a housewife. i love the idea of people calling me dr. hutchins though, that would be so cool. being a medical doctor is waht my heart desires, but i can't stand the sight of blood. that causes a problem. so, i figured i'd help people another way. if i do work i want to be a child psychologist. i have a passion for kids and want to help as many as i can. that's why i want to be a housewife, so i can be with my kids all day. i'm getting tired of typing now, it should have been 15 min, not 20. i wonder what other people are going to type about. my back is hurting from sitting like this so i'm going to stop. it's been 20 min anyway. i feel weird writing something for school and not using any kind of format, but i really enjoyed it because i hate english with a passion. i took two years of ap english and i didn't pass the ap test my junior year. didn't bother taking it my senior year. alright goodbye :)  ",1
"actually, i am sitting here in the library, wondering how my next four years are going to be. am i going to excel like i did in high school? or am i going to have an exceptional amount of stress that i will not be able to handle it. i don't know. this whole college thing is so new to me. i just came back from lunch with my roommate and her friends from back home. it's funny because we just had the most bizarre conversation. i just met these guys for the first time and we were talking about how and if one can tell is he or she is in love or not. it's pretty complicated if you really think about it long enough. sometimes when you meet someone of the opposite you're attracted to them right away. but what really attracts you to that person?  is it the way they smile? the way they simply look at you?  what is it really?  after it's obvious that the attraction is there you have to move on to the next step. which, for some people, is the hardest part. it's the whole approaching the person thing. you want to be yourself, but then at the same time you want to do something to impress the person. so you might comb your hair a special way or wear something new. it's the excitement that you like. it's sort of like a sandwich; the bread which is the first step, you the whole chasing thing. the meat is the relationship itself with extreme ups or extreme downs. finally, the other slice of bread is either the break up or.  it's interesting because two individuals may be in love and might not even know it. that's the neat part i think. but how do we know. i wonder if we will ever know because how do you go about finding out. what type of experiments would you do?

"i could talk about all the controversial issues that have swept the nation - clinton's sex scandal, the terrorist bombings, or any other factor that is found on the news. i could also write about everything that is wrong with society, however these things almost seem too common in today's everyday conversations. what used to seem controversial is now somewhat the fad. people are running around with bad attitudes because they are the """"rebellious"""" ones. it is truly not they that are rebellious. they are simply conforming to what is seen by the physical eye as rebellious. true rebellion is seen in writing. in the early years of the united states, people were hung and persecuted for their written work. i think that those moments should go down as some of the sadder times in our history. i think it was hawthorne who was greatly criticized for his scarlet letter. he wrote about a woman who was punished for adultery, but was she really punished?  she had to wear an outward symbol of her sin, but i think that hawthorn only included that to keep from being persecuted by authorities. the story was truly about the liberation hester prin found in her life. i don't think that is exactly what i was aiming at, but i am sure someone would understand. i like to think of myself as pretty well learned, however when i compare myself to others of greater intelligence i find myself utterly an idiot. while on the subject of intelligence i would like to take a minute to bash standardized tests. i do decently on them, however they in no way judge the full potential or caliber of any student. i feel as though there is something of importance that i could say, however seeing as i am the utter idiot, i find a rare occasion that i have anything interesting to say. i guess i would like to be a scientist in the sense of knowing knowledge for the sake of knowledge. i would like to soak up a lot of life while i have the chance but sometimes life gets in the way. i mean, sometimes i am trying so hard to enjoy life i forget that i am living it. there will never be another today. this is the only august 30, 1998 that i will ever experience. i would like to end it saying it was a day of my life well spent.

"it is now 12:32 and so i cannot wait until 12:52 because at that time my writing will be done. i type slowly anyway so i shouldn't have too much trouble typing for twenty minutes and producing much of a paper. i am not thinking about much at the moment except for the fact i am hungry and stressed out. the first week or two of school seemed pretty easy and then all of the sudden, yesterday it hit me. i am in college and at this point i need to get my priorities straight. i am enjoying myself too much and need to have more focus. my mind is just wondering a million miles a minute about nothing in particular. i need a job, but i'm so busy with school and stuff with my sorority, which is another story. i am not the proudest to be in a sorority. don't get me wrong, it's a great honor and a fun time, but i don't like the whole association that comes with it. my whole life does not revolve around guys and partying and allowing myself no friends or life outside of the sorority, as many of them do. in fact, i like so many people outside my sorority and would like to get to know them better that it makes me wonder if this is a good, more importantly, healthy fit for me?  i love austin because of it's diversity and that became one of the main factors in choosing schools between smu and here. there are so many interesting people and i want to get to know them all or at least try. wow, it's already been over 10 minutes and this has not been too hard. i used to write daily in my journal at home, but haven't had too much spare time to do that here, so maybe that is why i have been able to do this, and express myself so well. i enjoy so much being able to express myself on paper, which may explain why i write so much-journal, letters, poems. it helps me gain a sense of relief and since i don' express my feelings out loud too often, i need to do this daily, if not more so i can release all that i feel. i am excited about doing psychology this year because i hope to decide between the two majors i am struggling with. i am at the moment down for premed'nutrition and i really do want to go into medicine, but i've also always been interested in criminal psychology. it may be a little depressing, but i find it very interesting, and definitely want a job i love. a few months back, i read helter skelter and this encouraged my psychology path a little more, so i am hoping this class will help with my decision making. i guess we'll see. it is 12:51 now and time for me to stop.

"i came back to my home town for labor day. i didn't really want to, but my friend talked me into coming with her. i've only been gone a week and i'm already back. why? i'm not home sick. i guess i just didn't want to stay in austin when everyone i knew was leaving. i hope ajay made it to the airport. i'm really worried about him right now. i pray for his mom to get better but i just don't know. i want to promise him everything is going to be alright but i just can't. i wish he would stop drinking to make the pain go away but i guess if it makes him feel better right now. who am i to tell him what to do anyway? i wonder what time michael's game is tomorrow. my mom told me but i forgot. maybe i should have gone to dallas this weekend. i don't know? i think anything's better that being in odessa. football is such a big thing here. of course the first thing we do is go to jeesong's football game as soon as we got here. i'm glad ajay doesn't do anything as dangerous as that i already worry about him enough. i really think we are maturing in our relationship, learning to work through problems that most couples don't ever have in their entire lives. i don't know what he's going to do if he loses her too. i know she wants to be with his dad but isn't it selfish to leave your children. catherine just came in here to ask me what time i was going to get up. i said 10 but that wasn't early enough so we decided on 9:30. i am very happy with my schedule because i don't have a class before 9:30 and i like all of them. one thing about school i hate is that i'm always so tired. why can't i check my stupid email from my house? you would think a major computer system at a major university would have some way you could check it without having to download this and that. you should be able to enter your if or uteid and open a link site, but no. nothing is that easy. i hate computers and if i never had to use one i wouldn't mind a bit, but if i didn't know how i couldn't pass any of my classes. that is another thing. why is everything i need for a class on the internet? i feel sorry for people who have no clue how to use it. i thought kris was never going to hook up her computer but she finally discovered she had no choice. computers are our lives these days. what would the human race do without them? it's scary you know, our whole life is on this thing and if they know what their doing, anyone could find some thing you don't want them to have.

"today is only the sixth official day of class, and i am already stressed out. i know that i don't necessarily have to do everything in one day, but i feel  just so overwhelmed with everything that is going on. i wish i was already set  into the swing of things and simply taking things one day at a time. i get  nervous every time i think of what possibly lies ahead. i also have to start  looking for a job. i feel i do not have the time to work, but i believe mom and dad when they say it will help me adjust better if i have set things to do. i  guess it will also help me manage my time better, possibly even help me. i mean 5-10 hours a week is not a lot and it could even be interesting depending on the type of job i could find. i can look in to this of friday considering i only  have one class, although i seriously think i should take an extra hour or two  to simply lay down and rest. i haven't done that in a while. what else do i  have to do on friday?  look for a job, call home, rest, read, do homework, and  whatever else comes up. let's see, saturday. the game is on saturday, so i  guess i will do game stuff most of the day and go out after the game. at least  i will be able to get off campus and breathe a little easier. so far, i guess i like it here. i mean i am having fun and enjoying myself but i just got use to  doing nothing during the summer. no reading, no calculus, no tennis, no stu. -co. or nhs meetings. not to mention the constant weekend out of town tournaments. yet, i do miss tennis. even though it took up a lot of my time and effort, it  was always a blast. i miss the team especially, and all my close friends. i am  the only one of my closest friends that came to ut, but i guess it is all working out fine. if i went with them to college, i would be at a&m. naah, i'm ok here. i can always call them. i miss home. i knew that i would be homesick. even  though i like being here, i sometimes wish i was still at home, in my house, with  mom, dad, and even lori & angie. gosh, i never thought i would miss those two brats this much. oh, i miss grandpa and grandma and my nanny. i need to call  her tomorrow. it's already to late. i wonder what they are all doing right now. they are all probably asleep. i'm hungry, actually just thirsty. i could really go for a big, tall glass of sweet tea with a lot of ice. i can't wait for this  weekend. hopefully i will be able to sleep in late, or at least till 10:30 am. going to bed very late and waking up extremely early is just not a compatible combination. my legs are so sore from all the walking i have to do every day. i'm used to jogging and walking at least 3 miles most days, but walking here is  exhausting. uphill, downhill, up and down stairs. just thinking about it makes me tired. i need to get everything i need ready for tomorrow, but i think i am just going to lie down and watch tv till i fall asleep. i am so tired.

"well, unfortunately, i don't really like the way my mind works because it seems to churn in circles but never get anywhere. some people can just lay back and absorb what's going on around them, but i seem to overanalyze everything that goes on ' everything that's said to me, any gestures that people make towards me that could be insulting. they are all taken badly. i was dating this guy who got mad because i overanalyzed everything and he said, """"just do what i do and not think about it. """" but people don't seem to understand what that means. it doesn't work to tell yourself """"stop thinking about it"""", because then you're thinking about it. i've talked to people about it numerous times and all they tell me is that i'm wasting away my life because i'm stressing about nothing and getting nowhere and that i need to do something about it because i'm not getting anywhere and i'm getting old fast. when people hear that i'm just starting college and stuff, they say they wish they were in my position, but i wish i was in their position. i wish i had no stupid problems like boys that don't pay attention and friends that get jealous. but even though i say i don't want it, i create drama for my life, and if there's nothing going on, i create problems. i don't really do it intentionally, but i've realized that if a relationship is going great, then i always do something that causes problems or i can't trust that nothing is wrong and so i start blaming people for things and saying they're lying to me. i recently got into (recently meaning more like about the last 2 years) this thing where i thought i needed psychological help and i talked to my parents about seeing a psychiatrist'psychologist, except that it wasn't really a constructive conversation. it was more like i said i was tired of running and getting nowhere and other things that make me mad, but they just sort laughed and said """"don't be silly. """" the problem is that i didn't talk to them about anything that was going on, so they didn't know that there was any sort of problem. they thought that everything was perfectly normal and that i didn't really have any sort of problems. but i was looking in a book store for something about the psychology of love, just because it interests me, but instead i found something on the bargain shelf for 99 cents that was about dealing with minor psychological problems in yourself and others. but there's this problem that when i started reading the book, i thought i had all the problems in it. i started with something like ocd, and i related it to my life, and decided that's what my problem was, and then also with bipolar and definitely add. so i stopped reading it, because i would be doing something and get angry about it and then quote something from the book and my mom got so tired of it and said it was making problems for me and i should stop reading it. but it was so interesting to me. but i would be reading along and tears would come to my eyes because i would relate so much. then i would run into some of the disorders i didn't know much about, and relate them too, like autism. so i came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with me, and because of it, it was causing other problems, so that i had a combination of lots of things going on in my head. i don't know about all the other things, but i'm pretty much for sure that i have add. i did a research project on ritalin for my senior paper, and that's when i really started getting interested in it. the problem is that my brain is either on or off. i can be completely focused and completely engrossed or i can be completely uninterested and not even know what someone's saying to me. the worst part is that it gets worse when i have pms, for example, i worked at a restaurant and i went in one morning and was completely scatter brained and couldn't find anything and was just walking around in circles, and the manager said to me, """"wake up,"""" and i got so upset, i thought it was such an insult and after work i went home and cried because i knew i would have to deal with that for the rest of my life. my mind sometimes just leaves my head, and i can't think or concentrate, even on what i'm saying. i'll be in the middle of a sentence and then just get tired of what i'm saying and just stop and say, """"you know, whatever. """" i meet someone and ask them their name, but then don't listen for the answer, so i never remember anyone's name and i forget things that have just happened, and i know that it's going to last forever, because my mom has it, my grandmother has it, and my cousin is the worst. my cousin was diagnosed with bipolar disease and she was on something, i think it was prozac, and she had lots and lots of problems taking it. she's a lot better about taking it now, but when she doesn't, her """"cluelessness"""" kicks in worse than ever. so i think the cluelessness is tied into something greater that's a problem with me. my parents are completely against medicine and think it's against christianity, but i wish my whole family was on medicine. my brother and i both have anxiety attacks sometimes and my mom and dad are just crazy. my mom plays this nice, wonderful housewife that loves everyone and everything, but then she'll go crazy and do things like try and run away for a while and tell me that she almost threw everything from my floor out the window. it is completely like a scene out of the movie american beauty. i've been brought up thinking that you can have your emotions and that you're entitled to your emotions, but they aren't a public thing. so i used to go into my room and just flip out and cry and fall to the ground and silently scream and they never knew anything was wrong. so when i went to rhode island last summer, i was completely messed up. i was living in a dorm with someone, because i was at a summer school kind of thing for art, and so i couldn't get away and cry; there were always people there. i would get my lunch and try to eat with everyone, but i would start to take the first bite and then just start crying because i wanted to go home. i called home all the time and said i thought if i stayed that i was going to die, and i really thought i was going to. well, unfortunately my 20 minutes is up, so i can't talk anymore, but i have about 3 more hours of things to say, if not three weeks.

"i have been sitting in my room for the past four hours. i am addicted to a video game. i haven't studied. i haven't eaten. i haven't done anything except sit in front of my television screen and focus on my sega dreamcast. the game is virtua tennis. along with my roommates, i have begun to form somewhat of an addiction to the game. we play everyday and sometimes we play as late as 5:30 in the morning. we have played all sorts of different players from all over the world and it sometimes takes as long as two hours to beat the harder players. sometimes, i wish i could just take the game and throw it out the window. it is starting to run my life and it is drawing me away from my studies. every night when i do get to sleep, i think about tennis over and over again in my head. it is like a disease that is eating away at my mind. i finally drew myself away from the game because i am starting to realize that my classes are important. i am now beginning to focus more on my work. luckily, i haven't been in school long enough for this game to do anything to my overall effectiveness in any class. i think the main reason i was drawn away from the game is because i, along with my roommates, after hours and hours of playing, finally beat all the levels and achieved every goal we could possibly get out of the game. this video game has turned me into a lazier person than i have ever been and it makes it harder for me to concentrate on my studies. i must get rid of this game before it messes with my academics. therefore, i am going to the store sometime soon to return the game, or at least exchange it for something much less addicting. by doing this, i feel i can better focus on my class work and devote more time and effort to studying and making a good grade in all of my classes.

"today has seriously been the longest day ever and guess what? it's only the 4th day of classes. that's a horrible thing to think about. i stepped off of the 7th floor elevator at jester and was once again overcome by that odor of hamster cage. it's awful. i've been on some other floors and it doesn't smell like that. i wonder if it's the carpet or something, but obviously nobody cares enough about it to fix it, so that's cool i guess. i got a sign on my door that says they are going to paint all the doors starting tomorrow. i'm totally sure that its going to smell so much better on this floor after that. yeah right. this oatmeal cream pie is great, i'm so hungry because i haven't eaten all day yet, and all my professors successfully fried my brain. i hate when i don't know everything. well i don't mean everything because nobody knows everything, but more like. i hate when i can't understand something right away, probably because i know that means i have to spend extra time learning it later on and that's never any fun. i swear that when i used to eat these oatmeal cream pies they were bigger, so maybe the manufacturer downsized the product or something. i wouldn't be surprised, or maybe now i'm just so much bigger than the cookie itself, instead of when i used to eat them years ago. who knows? or actually who cares. kate just called me and she's not going to eat until later, so guess that means i'm going to the chem. review at 5. it'll probably be really good for me so i shouldn't complain, but complaining is so fun, yet so annoying all at the same time. i can't believe that i'm actually excited about going home this weekend, not for long, but i kind of feel like i'm missing out on so much in san antonio, even though i'm not. i can't wait to get some good mexican food. it's been too long. what a horrible affect working at a mexican restaurant all summer had on me. oh well. the football game this weekend should be extremely awesome !! i'm so excited, my first ut football games as a student in the student section. ha-ha. and actually i think my 3rd or 4th game ever to see, how cool. i saw something on austin's news talking about ordering the games on ppv. that's crazy. i really hope that doesn't mean that here in town all the games are blacked out and i can't watch them. like the away games for example. that'd be so cool if i could get tickets to the ou game. i hear that there's nothing like it, and i'm sure that's true. but you have to get pretty lucky and then you have to pay 85 bucks. and assuming that you get all that taken care of. you kind of have to make sure you know at least someone else going, meaning that they have to get through that whole process as well, pretty crazy, but i guess if all else fails i can order ir ppv for 40 bucks. yeah right, that game better be on abc or something. i actually called kenny today, after my first biology class. he didn't answer, hopefully it was because he was in class. i don't know why but for some reason i really feel like he doesn't like me the way he did before i went down to san antonio this past weekend. it's cool i guess. since i'm here and he's there, but i don't know. i wish that we wouldn't of met, so that i wouldn't have to deal with it. but then again i don't wish that because he's a cool guy. so much like me though, it's kind of scary. i wish that i could be the only one playing games and he would just profess his like for me everyday, but then again. if he did that i wouldn't like him, since it's all about the chase. crazy how those things work out. he's been exceptionally mean though. well just yesterday, but like he says it's his way of flirting, but ha-ha whatever. i like that boy. dang i just admitted it. i don't like him actually. i just don't know. i definitely don't think we're each others types though. he belongs around a much more rowdy """"karla"""" type and he might just be a little too crazy for me. sounds like a challenge. i'm pretty hungry for like some real food, i guess i'll go down to jcl in a little bit and find something, that cinnamon toast crunch and oatmeal cream pie just didn't do it for me. and i'm exceptionally tired too. i ended up being 5 minutes late to my calculus discussion this morning, and i don't think it even helped me that much since i barely got a b on the homework. man, i miss high school math classes. everything was definitely explained so much better, so yeah needless to say i'm pretty freaked out about that, i'm actually freaked out about all my classes. oh well.

"     i'm really full right now because i ate a lot of food tonight. i as going to go out to dinner with other friends, but just decided not to go. te reason is that idid't want to bother them. they are all guys, and i didn't want to be the only girl. anyway, i found out later that there were some other girls coming, but i just eating at that time already. a guy i like went there, too. i was going to go there because of him, but just didn't want to make it obvious taht i wanted to be with him. i am worried that he may not like me, but i'm pretty positive that he at least is interested in me. i was very worried in the biginning, though, because i wanted everything to happen so fast. all my friends advised me not to be that way since the most stable relationship is usually formed after a long time of being together. i guess i'm too impatient and too negative. i envy a lot of people who are positiv and self-confident. they are very proud of who they atr and not afraid of doing anything they want to do. i want to be that way. sometimes i'm just too scary to start doing anything. however, what is really strange is that i am self-confident. i am usually a leader among my classmates and always think i will do good at most of things. i think i'm not confident of love. especially, whenever i have somebody i like, i never consider myself worthy for him. usually, i will think he won't think i'm pretty and so on. all these negative images are pictured in my brain. i do that because i don't want to be so positive, what if i think of all these good things, and they never happen? what if something bad happens? what if he says he doesn't like me? it's much better to think of worse and let good things happen. however, sad thoughts make me really depressed often. i become so biased that i won't see what really is going on. i'd like to be so wise. i don't want to be biased or anything. i guess in order to be wise, i need to read as many books as i can. also, i think i need more experience. experience makes one mature and smart. when i was young, i didn't understand why people call the old the wise. however, as i grow, i realized so many things that i now started to understand. the longer i live, the more i see, hear, and think. i am so grateful that i'm still alive and anxious to learn more about the world. there are so many things i don't know, and that fact just makes me go on. i love learning, and sometimes, i get frustrated becuase i feel like there's not enough time for me to know all these things. it's just wonderful to see the world and all there different things within. different cultures, people, languages,and all these other things are very fascinating. i wonder how and when i will be able to experience everything! it is my dream to travel aroungd the world. i would love to travel and learn many things. i wonder i will be able to get a job and still traveil while working. i hope that can happen. maybe, i can travel during vacations, but that sounds not enought for me. i will like to travel several times a year. i really think ther's not enough time to see and learn. this is why i try to do more things everyday, but now i'm getting too lazy. college life is exciting, but also make ",0
"why did these girls from my hometown just call me and invite my roomate and i to a frat party? what were they thinking? these silly girls went to school with me for 4 years, and all of a sudden i have changed into a college girl that wants to drink, party, and hang out with jocks?? uhhh, i don't think so. i mean, it is a nice gesture, i guess. i would almost rather they not call at all. that would make me feel so much better, i hate seeing all of those kingwood people in austin. i eamn, i did come here to expand my horizons. i do not think that frat parties are neccessary to experience what college is all about. so, i decided to stay at home and work on psychology homework. why? it isn't like i am enjoying this. i would much rather be out watching a band, or listening to music, or hanging out with my best friend holly. i really like the fact that we are roomates now. over the summer and for about the last year or so, we didn't get to hang out very much. but, now that we are here, it is like we are getting to know each other all over again, and i love that. even though we are extremely different now, she is like part of my family and makes this huge campus seem somewhat small and unintimidating. she is also a lot like me, like when those girls called, i could tell by her facial expressions that it was a ridiculous idea. it was almost as though i could read her mind. my foot itches. tomroow, i am going to church for the first time in about 6 months. i don't know why i stopped going, maybe i got too pessimistic or maybe my spiritual side just died with the loss of some important friends. i am not really sure, but i am certainly hoping to revive that side of me, because i definately need some sort of outlet for all of this stress and lonliness. no, that is not the right word, i am not lonely, maybe just scared of what i am to become being spiritually dark. why did that happen? i don't understand so many things, but i am trying. i have also been going with holly, my best friend, to her church related organization on campus. i really like it a lot, maybe things will change soon. i miss my mom. i hope that she is ok without me, and my little brother too. he is in second grade and doing so well, but he hates school. he isn't very attentive, but very creative. i miss my family, we were very close. except for my dad, he is a jerk. i wonder sometimes if i will ever find it important to speak to him again. i don't really think so. he does nothing but cause stress and harm, he doesn't pay attention unless it is something bad. he doesn't know me, yet he seems to evaluate my every bad move, without noticing the good ones. i am not a girl that holds onto grudges, but i am too pessimisstic right now to forgive him. maybe it will come in time. i hope that i am not studying the wrong things for class. i often wonder how i am going to make the grades. i mean, i know i can, i am very smart, but it is hard to concentrate right now with all of these things happening at once. especially coming to college for the first time. i never dreamed that it would be as draining as it is. once again, i am so glad to have holly here to keep me in my comfort zone. it is said that you make some life-long friendships here, but i am struggling with all of these new people. i have not found the time to really get to know anyone that is new yet. it is like they are all aquaintences. i am sure that that will all change, once i am in the swing of things and i do not refer to old friendships as a comparison. why are we doing this assignment? am i part of some sort of research? i would like to know, i feel like i am spilling all of these things onto paper, maybe someone will read them and take them into account, maybe not. maybe i am just another research rat. why do they always do research on rats? i don't get it? if you are going to hurt an animal, why is it always rats? i mean, isn't there something that is closer to humans genetically than rats? maybe monkeys. but i do not like that animal research idea at all. give it up. we are human, we are not supposed to understand everything that walks, breathes, and thinks. we should just contemplate it, talk to people, and think about them to ourselves. why should we impose onto other species? what if it was the other way around? wouldn't we think. """"why do they even care? it isn't as if they can change anything, even if they wanted to?"""" people are people, it is instinct, why should we cut it apart. it almost ruins the whole experience of life on earth. or mars for that matter. do we care if there is life on mars? unless we interact with them in some way, why should we care? technology is killing man, man is killing himself. life is supposed to be fun and exciting. not facts, computers, and stress about the y2k crap. oh well, i don't understand. why am i thinking all of this at one time? pretty weird how it all just sort of comes to my fingers as i am typing, but i suppose i am thinking it for a reason. i got a package today, it was a necklace from a friend in houston. it was nice but he said taht when he saw it it made him think of me. why? i asked myself did that necklace make him think of me? it really isn't anything like my fashion. and there was no letter inside, only a necklace. i mean, it is the thought that counts, but that is ridiculous. i think i deserve more credit for my individuality than that. hahaha. ok, i am really hoping that some good shows come around here in austin. i miss the punk rock scene in houston. i am sure i just need to get to know people who like it and just start going. i found a club that i am really into now, it is called the concert comittee of the texas council. i am extremely excited about that. i wonder if i am going to dream about any of thise weird stuff tonight. i wonder if it will stay inside my head and dwell there until my eyelids close. then, all of the thoughts will explode and i will have one huge lng dream about my dad, holly, church, monkeys, rats, and music. that would be weird huh? i definately think so. well, my back is definately starting to hurt from sitting in this stupid dorm chair for so long. i want a back rub. ad you are probably wondering why my assignment is long. i can type extremely fast for some weird reason. i am done. enjoy me *cara* ",0
"today has been a good day. at first i was afraid that ut was going to be a difficult experience for me since i had never been far away from home for more than one week, but it has turned out well. i've met a lot of people. last night, i had a really good time. even though i was out really late it was an enjoyable experience. i have tried to maintain friendships with people from my small town of laredo. although many of them weren't close friends they are still a contact to a world so different from the world that i used to live in. nonetheless, i don't think i want to live in the past. i want to live life to the fullest. in fact, i decided a few days ago that the only way to adjust and have fun, i have to remember that i am a naturally outgoing person even though shyness sometimes overcomes me. due to this, i have met more people. i do hope that the people i have met so far aren't psycho, though. you never know who you are talking to in a town this size or what that person must be thinking. last night i had to ask some random person for a ride because the dorm dorms were locked and there was no one there to answer. under any normal circumstances i would not have done such an irresponsible and dangerous acts but i was scared and i didn't want to spend the night in the lobby. as a result, i see that ut and austin are turning me into a new person that i always wanted to be. uninhibited. fun. wild. although these characteristics have always been in me i realize now that they are barely rearing their heads for a a new beginning of adventure and excitement.  i don't miss home as much as i thought i would. i see that freedom and self-rule has begun to change my personality (hopefully for the better). however, i can't help but think that it may all be wrong. what if home is what kept me safe and secure. being away from my boyfriend is the hardest. it has been two weeks since i last saw him and already doubts have sprung into my mind. i think of him and don't miss him the way i thought i would. i do in a way but not as badly as expected. a friend told me to keep her posted on my feelings and what i was thinking but i feel that talking about my lack of feelings would be almost as bad as being unfaithful to him. nontheless, ut is proving to be a different and definitely exciting experience that i hope to enjoy for many more years. the future lies ahead and i await it with an anxiousness i have never known. i hope it all works out in the end.

"i woke up this morning and my words from last night at 1am, """"can i have a 6 piece chicken tender and small fries to go"""" echoed in my ears. i felt guilty. within five minutes of ordering i had scarfed down the whole thing. although my body wasn't hungry, i was thinking about food and i started to have major cravings for something filling. i sent myself on a mission to quench my thoughts, not my stomach. is it normal to eat when you think about food and your body isn't hungry? does thinking about food imply that you really are hungry even though your stomach isn't growling? this also brings up the issue of will power. i usually have strong will power, but with food it is another story. my body feels weighted down by guilt today. i went to tops the other day to look at pictures and i looked fat in all the pictures i saw of myself. i'm sure every freshman promises themselves that they won't gain the dreaded """"freshman fifteen. """" i refuse to believe that it is an inevitable event in my life right now. i know how to avoid gaining the weight; exercise, eat healthy food, and above all, don't have late night snacks. my will power crumbles late at night when i see food or if my belly doesn't have that full feeling. getting out of bed i could feel the unused calories building up in my body. i didn't eat breakfast and went to the gym where i worked out for almost two hours today in hopes of burning off last night's calorie fest and hopefully today's too. when i returned to my room i was in a bad mood, felt very lonely and as i told my mom, """"i'm not feeling like myself. """" i was depressed. i only felt good about myself today when i was exercising. i wanted to go eat lunch, but i felt guilty about even thinking about eating. i love to eat. it brings me satisfaction, comfort, and pleasure. however, my body image tampers with my enjoyment. i am not over weight but i feel like it. as strong, smart, and confident as i am about myself and who i am, i have been sucked into the belief that i ought to be skinny. it is amazing how easily my mood depends on my eating habits.

"after my first week at the university of texas, my mind is filled with a mixture of thoughts and emotions. on one hand, i am excited about starting at a new school and the opportunities that await me. however, i also worry whether i'll be able to balance the social aspect of my life with the challenges of school. first and foremost in my mind presently is pledgeship, which is drawing constantly nearer. what am i going to have to do? how am i going to be able to stay at the house all night and do others' chores and keep a good gpa? it will surely be difficult, but i am fairly confident i can do it. i have always been successful at overcoming challenges in my life. the hardships of pledgeship combined with the rigors of being in the business honors program should make for a busy semester, to say the least. i feel a great amount of pressure to perform. i have to make at least a 3. 5 to stay in the bhp, and 3. 25 to keep my scholarship money. this is the root of the nervous feelings within me. there is also a great deal to be excited about this semester also. i am excited about the experiences i will have, the people i will meet, and the friends i will make. this semester will be unlike any other i've had in my life. thinking of the times i've had in the past 9 days since i arrived here makes me certain i chose a great school to attend. the bhp will offer me incredible future opportunities, and the friendships i forge with my pledge brothers will last a lifetime. i still can't believe that i'm already in college and moved away from home. i will face a great number of challenges this semester, but i am excited about them and overcoming these challenges will make this semester all the more rewarding.

"right now i feel somewhat relaxed after having seen one of the most gory movies of all-time. the title of the movie is event horizon in which a ship is taken over by evil spirits which have been taken onboard through a dimension warp. my brain feels completely clouded over because i don't really want to start school. i also want to bet on football pretty badly. this past weekend i lost a pretty nice piece of change while none of my teams covered the spread. i hope to do much better this weekend, but it has me worried.     my toe also seems to be giving me trouble because it got infected about one year ago but it never seems to get all the way healed. maybe there is a chance that it will give me problems for the rest of my life. i'm pretty tired right now since it is 1:15 in the morning. i feel i have had a productive day though because i went to class today and got meaningful information from them. especially in this class. i usually have no sort of interest in scientific things like the brain but the lecture seemed really interesting. i liked the explanations that were given from several things in everyday life. it has also just hit me that mr. pennebaker said he was from midland, which is also my hometown. i think its a pretty good place, you just have to have a little imagination that's all. i'm thinking that since i ran so much this evening my back might actually be sore because of it. hell, i don't know though. i could use a nice woman in my life right now, but i am extremely picky unless i've been boozing it a little. it is cold somewhat in my room right now and there are many things that i must take of before tomorrow. i need to do some laundry and do some reading for class. i get extremely irritated when things don't operate smoothly. i wish i knew more about computers so that i could take care of my email problem. a nice cheeseburger would be excellent right now but i don't really want one do to the fact that i'm trying to lose a few lbs. i'm debating whether or not to turn the tv on and watch a movie or just go straight to bed. last night i almost got in a fight with one of my pledge brothers and to tell you the truth. i think the guy knows i could have killed him because he is not crazy enough to take me. i'm really not in a position            do some work for a good cause. i need a damn job so i can get some money to pay off some debts and be in good standing with my parents. one thing i've noticed recently is that everyone talks bad about people behind their backs. i mean i've sat down and talked bad about probably everyone i know. people pick out one person's weakness or what they consider to be a weakness and bash them pretty good when they aren't around. i know people say stuff about me when my back is turned but hey so did i. i figure its nothing to think about to seriously unless someone is spreading lies. that is bullshit. i've been writing now for 22 minutes i'll stop. is there any that i could  ",0
"so many things to do. must read in rhetoric today. two whole chapters. i wonder if i should drop that class. she seems nice but only gives 3 or 4 a's. i could be one of those a's. but what if i'm one of those c's that she says are """"solid writers""""?? wish i was a good writer. after i read must read chemistry and psychology if i don't start soon i'll never start. and lord knows if i get behind in any of my classes, i'll never catch up again. i'm glad that i bought the notes today for chemistry. now i know what to study. but it was expensive our professor must be making a fortune! can't wait until 7:30pm i can take a break from life and focus on me! me me me me. i'll finally be able to go to the gym and work out. i've gained so much weight already. i wonder if my boyfriend notices and just doesn't say anything. i bet he notices. he never complements me anymore. i'm a little disappointed in myself for letting my self go. i should've been more cautious about my eating habits. sometimes i just eat because there's nothing to do not because i'm hungry. i know that's wrong. to make matters worse my boyfriend is such a hard core work out freak. although i'm skinny, i'm slowly losing my girlish figure that attracted him to me. i know for a fact he can do better than me, but why is he with me? he says i'm everything anyone could ever want but i have so many flaws. for instance, i have the quickest temper and stubbornness in the whole wide world. my hair is still damp from taking a shower. that shower was good. it washed away the whole afternoon. all the stress. i hate being late. that's probably why i'm always half an hour early for all my classes. everyone thinks i'm a nerd but i just consider myself punctual. quite an overachiever. i like being an overachiever. it's the most commonly used word to describe me with. i always try to get ahead. that's why i'm always so stressed out. sometimes i wish i was not such a worry wart. i want to be laid back, really i do, but my happiness comes with having everything done and done on time and done well. the feeling of finishing and completing everything thoroughly and fully is the best feeling in the whole world. and that's what makes me an overachiever. this project isn't even done now. it's supposed to be done in a couple of weeks. i tried to do this project the day after proof. pennebaker assigned it but for some odd reason the site was down. i guess it just wasn't meant to be. hmmm. what should i eat for dinner. it's $0. 30 chicken wing night at pluckers. i live right above pluckers so it'd be easy to get to but i still have left overs in the fridge so i'll save myself the 3 or 5 dollars and eat in again. i wish i was rich. i wouldn't have to worry about how much dinner cost. i remember the day when it used to be like that. but i'm glad i ran away. i'm with jeff now and he's better than having all the money in the world. i kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 12 years of overachieving. ut isn't bad. it's not great either. some people say it's like an ivy league school but i highly doubt that. i would pick an east coast school over hicktown ut anytime. but since i'm here i have to make the best of this situation and endure the poor weather and large campus. six more minutes of writing. that means i can start thinking about what to do next. i think i'll read psychology since that's what i'm doing now. just the first chapter tonight then the first chapter in chemistry. that should do me for now then rhetoric i have to read chapters two through three. i think i've got it together now. 4 more minutes. wow, it's already been twenty minutes! this assignment relieved me of a lot of stress already! now i just have to read and take really good notes. no more online junk to take care of anymore. i have using the computer. don't people know that handwriting things is the best way to learn and memorize? well, i guess for me others love it. yes one more minute. i think i'll snack and study. it keeps me motivated. i guess that's it. i enjoyed this project!

"i'm sitting here typing on the computer and the clock is a little bit distracting, but i think i can handle it. i just connected my printer to the computer with a cable i didn't know i had. there are sirens going off outside i hope this is a safe area to live and hey my dad just walked in the door i wonder if i'm a fast enough typist i really like the picture i have in my room its of some toucans and its got a lot of color in it because i like color my couch in the living room is red and my dog won't stop barking outside. i think i'm going to go get her after i finish this assignment. i just took the long quiz so i'm tired of staring at this computer screen  i still have to go find what to wear tomorrow and get a parking permit my phone is ringing hmmm should i answer it or keep typing i guess i'm going to keep typing because it stopped i hope it wasn't very important or someone doesn't think i am intentionally ignoring them my dad should be coming back soon i think he is across the street talking to the neighbors who seem to be very nice i need him to help me hang up some mirrors and finish my fence sometime this week so he can leave that doesn't sound very nice i just noticed the air conditioning is making a really weird sound my dad just walked in with my puppy her name is trinket if he claims not to like dogs i really can't tell by the way he babies her its kind of funny oh you know what happened to me today was i solved a mystery and it was kind of funny the way it happened i was online and i tried iming my best friend and she wouldn't answer back so i was thinking ok maybe she is mad at me so i called her and she said she wasn't online so i thought ok who is trying to steal her identity she wanted me to try and find out who it was so i started asking the person numerous questions awww my little puppy just came and is trying to type on the keyboard i think she just wants attention   ok its really hard to type right now she keeps trying to lick my hand ok my dad is calling her to go outside and she won't listen i think she has selective hearing the air conditioner just came on again with that weird noise ouch that really hurt trinket just scratched my arm with her sharp nails i need to take her to petsmart to get her a new collar oh as i was saying about the mystery person online who was posing as my best friend, yeah i kept bugging them until they finally answered back saying please don't try to contact this address again (i think they were getting fed up with all the questions) but i kept asking who is this and it turned out to be her grandma in arkansas!  it was so funny cause i was like don't you have your own sn and then it was like oh hey i know you! and she started talking to me about how i was liking ut and all and people keep signing on my buddy list and i really hope this clock stops soon because my phone is ringing again but i don't think i should stop to answer it i guess i'll call back later its only 8:56 so its not too late i just really don't want to get up in the morning oh i just got this really bad cramp in my side and its hurting really bad i wonder if appendicitis is on your left or right side cause if its on the right  oh its stopped maybe it was the way i was laying on the floor its kind of uncomfortable but until i can get my desk and everything set up for my computer i guess i have to keep typing down here on the floor i'm kind of tired right now i still need to go check on my parking pass. i hope these aren't supposed to be written in complete sentences but i don't think they are because its a stream of consciousness paper and it seems like i keep worrying about too much so i'm not going to worry about it anyways the time is almost up i wonder what matt is doing right now i was talking to him last night and all the sudden the phone just cut off because i think it was his phone that ran out of batteries so it just died right there in the middle of the conversation which i really hate that i had to finish my thought this thing is addicting ",1
"this is really boring, i'm so tired, i think i might take a nap after this but i have to write my social work notes. i wonder what will is doing in his class right now, i think this exercise will show that i think about him too much. i wonder if stacey is in class. did angel get the message i sent to her cell phone? should i go home this weekend? if i go home, i think i'll want to stay there, but if i don't go home i'll miss seeing my lil brother and i know he really wants to see me, its a good thing i haven't told him i'm thinking about it yet. i really want to get me and will tickets to the football game and to the austin city limits music fest. i wonder if by getting him tickets i'm encouraging him to ditch class. i don't want to encourage him to do that, i want him to do well more than anything because i know that he wants out of utsa so bad. i hope that he stops hanging out with that arthur kid so much, that kid is trouble. he isn't going anywhere. will has so much potential to go so many places, and arthur is just going to drag him down. omg its only been three minutes. this is crazy, i type fast and there is going to be so much stuff here. i wonder if my hands will hurt at the end of this. i guess it is keeping me awake. i'm so tired, i just want to sleep once in awhile. i actually did sleep last night, i only woke up once i think. its so hard to sleep, i don't know why. its probably because of this horrible dorm, with its horrible smells, horrible neighbors, and the massive amounts of noise associated with traffic outside. i was so tired that i took a freakin nap at russ and will's apt. awwww. russ is so awesome, i think he might be one of the best people i know. i wish more guys were like russ. i wish will would start being more like russ and a lot less like arthur. arthur is so dull. who in their right mind only thinks about parties, drinking, and easy girls? he is so one dimensional, and will is so much more than that. i wish he could make more friends that actually have substance. i wish i could make more friends too. oh, i made a friend today in sociology. i let her borrow my notes since she said she wasn't in class. slept through or something. that sucks. i hope i don't do that, but since i have no friends here, its not really a possibility right now. man, i feel like such a pathetic loser here. i have friends, i really do, i keep telling myself this. but i don't think anyone here believes me. i walk around all alone all day, and only talk to people when i have to. its such a pathetic existence. then i come back, study, run errands or work out, eat, and sleep. i talk to my friends online a lot, and on the phone a lot. i wish they were here. i hope that russ and will are here next year, and that nicki, stacey, maris, kayla, tracy, and everyone ends up here. maybe plunkett will too, that would be fun. i wonder how he is. i hope he is ok. he doesn't talk to me too much. i think he probably does miss having everyone around. i wonder if marc is ok. i think underneath his happy front he is the saddest person i know. weird. he is a great person though, good heart, good intentions, doesn't always follow through though. man, i wish i was back in january. january was the start of an awesome semester of high school. i think i was actually popular in high school, which is weird to think about. i was never like the prom queen or anything, but i had about a ton of friends, and i knew they were all loyal. they were so great, they still are great. i miss hanging out with my guys. they were so much fun this summer. craziness. and my girls, i want to go dancing with them. there are so many clubs here, and it would be so much fun if we all went. but for some reason, its not as much fun going with ppl i don't really know that well, and don't care to hang out with. like christyn soland. ha, i was actually glad that she went to san antonio with me this weekend. i felt kinda bad for ditching the yl ppl, but i think it would have been awkward for them with me around, esp since they think so horribly of me. i don't want to be around ppl that hate me anyways, or are fake friends to my face. i don't know, i tend to bash her a lot, and esp will does too. we hate her mutually, ha. damn, we should just go out or something. i can't believe his mom thought we were. i can't believe everyone thought we were. that is so strange, i wonder what he thought about it, but he didn't seem to care at all when stacey told him. he kinda just stared at us with an apathetic look on his face. i wonder where that frame i made him went. he seemed to really think it was cool. i'm so glad we got to go to lunch and hang out. i really want him to be here with me next year, but more than that i want him to get out of utsa and be somewhere he really wants to be, whether that be here or not. i wonder if he wore that burnt orange polo to the game last week. i hope we get to go to a game together, that would be so much fun. we have fun together i think. i can't believe that i miss everyone so much, and i can't believe that i care about him so much, as a person, as a friend. its scary. its like the whole robby thing. robby. i wonder how he is. i can't believe he had a girlfriend. i wonder if he still does. he was such a great guy, he still is i'm sure. he thinks he has to define himself now by drugs or smoking or horrible music. i'm not understanding that. i wonder if wonkie is doing the same thing? i can't believe she would smoke. i bet she couldn't believe i would drink. why does armando think i would give it up to will. i may like the guy, but that doesn't mean i want to jump in a bed with him. i hope he was just kidding. i wonder why robby went off the deep end and pushed everyone away. i hope that doesn't happen to will, i hope he doesn't push me away. if he pushes me away, he has arthur left, and russ, but he will push russ too i'm sure if he pushes me. i hope that arthur falls off a cliff and breaks both his legs and arms, and has to leave utsa so that he doesn't ruin will. i hope that he doesn't kill him. it made me almost cry when russ was kidding about that. it makes me so worried when he says he doesn't mind getting into a car with drunk arthur. i know he knows its wrong. does he think trying to validate it to me will make it ok? what would i do if he died and i was the last one to talk to him, and i knew he got in a car with a drunk arthur? i would feel guilty. but there's nothing i could do about it. i couldn't stop him. there's no way. he is making decisions on his own now. well i don't think he is doing a very good job of it. why does he tell ppl that he got high or drunk and decided to go to utsa? i know he remembers that it was me saying he should go for it. i convinced him to go there, like he convinced me to go here, and now we're both not happy. i think i handle it better. i don't know that running away to san antonio to see him'everyone is better, but at least i'm not screwing things up by being drunk all the time and fo ",1
"i'm realizing, as i begin to write this, that this psychology assignment is probably the weirdest thing i've ever had to do for a class. on one hand, it seems utterly useless, but then again, i know nothing about psychology, so i'm fascinated to find out how they can use something like this for scientific purposes. i just got my wind ensemble music about half an hour ago, and i'm already nervous. i'm also really hungry. i should be meeting ashley for lunch right now in kinsolving, but i'm doing this assignment instead. hope she's not mad. i don't think she will be. christina wanted to eat over there anyway, and i'd like to try their food, so we'll probably go over there for lunch. maybe not dinner. i have rehearsal tonight for lhb. dang it. the last thing i feel like doing right now is marching. it's so hot. i really miss doug. he's been on my mind every once in awhile, ever since i started school. i don't know why i think about him so much. i've tried to deal with these feelings before, and they've gotten better, but only a little bit. i think of him as a friend, but a part of me still likes him a lot. i don't know why. i should know better. he's the last person i'd ever want to date. but maybe that's why i like him so much, that whole """"opposites attract"""" theory. i don't know. actually, it's not that i don't want to date him, but he has so many qualities that i shouldn't like. when i think about his friendship with carolyn, it always stirs up jealousy inside me. i know i shouldn't get jealous of her. they were such good friends  more than friends  for awhile, and there's no reason that i should mean as much, or more, to him than she does. i should be happy for them. i love carolyn. she's one of my best friends, but at the same time, she drives me crazy. i don't think she realizes how much it hurts me when she talks about how sweet doug is to her and everything. i wish she'd just make up her mind between him and zag. but the more i think about it, the more i don't miss all that crap from high school. i know there are going to be other guys that i meet  i already have met several in lhb  but it's just that i don't know anyone well yet. there's nobody that i can just talk to, or sit beside and listen to them talk, like i did with doug. i really miss those times when he'd play with my hair or hold my hand or stroke my cheek. all the times carolyn wasn't around. weird. no, i need to stop thinking like this. what did my book say? i'm supposed to wait for god to put someone in my life. i shouldn't go chasing after guys (like carolyn does) because that'll only get me hurt. i try so hard to be good and do what my christian friends say, but i guess it's that human nature that makes me want to do the other things. i'm really getting hungry now. i think she just finished her calculus, so maybe we can go eat when i'm done with this. i wonder if dad ever found my phone last night. i hope i can remember where i put it, because i really need to have it. i wonder how matthew is doing with his region band music. i'm so nervous for him. i really want him to beat brandon. no, i don't. i just want him to get some more confidence when he plays in front of people because he is so good. well, pretty good, at least. if he had some attitude, or if he didn't get so nervous, he'd be awesome. i wish i could fix it for him. doug has so much confidence. matthew needs to be more like doug. in some ways, at least. i miss me. nicks, too. sometimes this whole college thing feels temporary, like i'll go back to school in a week, and everything will be normal, and fun, and stressfree. jennifer and jean and rosie are doing a good job, but there are so many things that i wish they could do differently. conducting bugs me the worst. or maybe it's just the fact that they've replaced me. i'm no longer needed at connelly, and that really bothers me. they might miss me, but they don't need me anymore to keep things running, and it hurts to think about that. of course, it's kind of nice to be at the other end of the spectrum for awhile, and not know what's going on. being a freshman is nice, to a point, but then it just drives me nuts. i wish i had a tape player so i could listen to mr. p's tape. i can't believe wind ensemble is starting tomorrow. i wish i had my car down here with me. i feel so isolated, helpless. i'm homesick, but not really. i just miss doug, i think. i wish i could've seen him this weekend. i can't wait until i make some good friends here, but all the guys i've met so far are so immature. it's frustrating.

"i am reading a book called atlas shrugged and it is affecting my consciousness and belief system more significantly than any novel i've ever read. ayn rand wrote it and it's just a metaphorical portrayal of her philosophy of objectivism, but the book touches on subjects that i feel are very important to all humans. i find myself newly enraged at those incompetent people of the world. not because they are incompetent but because they are the ones who ask for help and breaks and favors by those people who built the society in which we live. the anti monopoly law is a perfect example of this. why should the men who built the country be penalized just to give the other people who weren't strong, smart, or productive enough a """"fair"""" chance. it really is disgusting. just as is, in the theatre department they don't allow one person to get too many leads in order to give other people a chance. this is stupid. if those others who would never otherwise get a chance can't cut it, then they don't deserve a chance to begin with do they?  i also notice the moral depravity of some of my friends. these are the ones who are joining fraternities in order to get breaks when they go into the real world. personally i would hate knowing that i found my station in life by the grace of one of my old drinking buddies. i would much rather know that my hard work, intelligence and talent got me to where i was. but not many people think like this anymore. i guess that i just have way too much faith in my abilities, but i'm glad i do. ayn rand is right in saying that incompetency should not be rewarded in society, but it is. so in the book, all of these genius men, who have built of the industrial world are becoming much too regulated, to the point of ridicule, so one guy called john galt decides that all of the producers should go on strike against the looters. he decides to stop the motor of the world - hence, atlas shrugged. so one by one, men who own oil companies and car, and coal, etc. starts disappearing and the world fall apart. it is such a great argument too. you should never take advantage of the hand that feeds you, especially if you haven't the abilities to perform their task as well as they have. this is not, however, indicative of a condoning of ruthless, unfair capitalism. the men who build the world in this book form a secret utopia and their motto is that they will never give to any man anything, nor will they take more than is their due. thus, charging unfair prices etc. is just as bad as giving breaks to the dumbasses. anyway, i have this friend called jason and since this is for psychology, hopefully someone will read this and can tell me what his problem is. actually he's not my friend anymore because i don't want such an asshole for a friend. he's the only person i've ever met in my life that truly believes that he's better than everyone around him. you hear of people speaking of someone like this but they are never quite as serious about it as i am. he thinks that he's found the only way to living, and it's so wrong it's sad. the only thing by which he measures success is economic gain. i have heard say horrible things about all of his """"friends"""" and have heard what he's said about me behind my back. i've overheard him saying that he's set  in life because when his dad dies he's going to get 500000. this wouldn't be so bad if his parents abused him or something but they are the nicest people in the world and give him everything he wants. of course, this is probably the root of his problem. i've noticed that he doesn't go to parties unless he's throwing them. if he actually does go to one, afterward he makes it a point to call out all of the things that in his eyes were bad about it. he doesn't want to hang out with these people because they are irresponsible and are potheads, while he smokes just a much pot as they do. and, they pay rent and go to school all on their on while he does nothing but loot off of his parents. he really has sever problems. i guess you'd just have to know him to know exactly what i mean, the biggest asshole ever. anyway, uhmmmmmm, i went back home this weekend to get my car and i got to see my dog. i missed her more than i missed my parents. she's so pretty. she's a golden lab retriever and she sleeps in my bed with me every night, just as she has since she was a puppy. the other day my mom almost got her run over by letting her go to the bathroom without the leash, she ran out in front of a car and they had to swerve up into our yard to miss her. pretty scary. but she was ok thank god, just really scared. she had her tail between her legs all night long. my roommate is really cool and nice thank god. you never know what kind of freak you're going to get when you go pot luck, thank goodness he's not a freak. he's listens to a different kind of music than i do, but that's cool, because i'm learning a new genre. anyway, my 20 minutes are up so bye bye.

"i don't have too much on my mind right now, and if im worrying about anything, it may be about classes. this class in particular is not too troublesome, but this is my first year in college, and im noticing that the style of school is in many ways different. and its not that i don't think i will be able to adapt, but i am a little intimidated. the laid-back style of college allows for a lot of distractions and freedom. so i believe that if i set a pattern now to get everything that i need done, i will be much better off.   not only, are the classes here different, but my whole social life has been turned upside down. i don't know whether i should  let go of most of my old acquaintences from high school, and dive right into new friendships. or to hang on to the people who i feel know me the best. i loved my high school years. i loved the people i grew close to, i loved the environment, i loved the things i was involved in. and now, i don't have any of those things to comfort me. i loved theatre, i remember all the plays i was in and all the fun times and great bonds i made with people. including the director. he was like my second father, someone i could really talk to, but also someone who taught me a lot about myself. and the things he taught me really can't be put into words, but rather they can be applied to my life right now. i feel so much more grown up after growing close to him in 4 years and feel like if he believes in me, there is no reason for me not to. that may be my one biggest flaw. at times i have somewhat low self-esteem. well, to refine that statement, i doubt myself and my worth at times. never at a dangerous level, im not anywhere near depressed, but i do tend to put others before myself. i care so much about people in my life, and i expect the same from others. but that isnt the way it is most of the time. i put my heart out there, and often it gets passed over.   and on that subject, that is the main reason why i broke things off with my high school boyfriend. there were other contributing factors, but this past summer, i finally put myself before him and realized that i wasnt getting what i wanted out of the 8 month old relationship. i loved him so much, and deep down, i know he loved me, and still does. but he didnt try hard enough. and he says now he realizes that he didnt treat me as good as he should have, and i knew that he would eventually see that, that is why i broke it off--to make it obvious something was wrong. and it took him a long time to see that. we were best friends, and maybe that is why it took me so long to say something. because i had so much faith in someone so close to me, i was sure i was exaggerating things, being selfish. but after enough people telling you that you deserve better, it really starts to make you think. i would always be the one putting forth the effort, i would always aplologize, i would always go out of my way for him, i would compliment him, etc. and ultimately, he wanted an easy relationship. he didnt want to have to make me feel special, even if he felt it deep down. and now he tells me this. and its very unlike him to see that he was insensitive for so long. he usually doesnt see things like that clearly. but maybe losing a girlfriend and best friend made him see things differently. i miss him though. i was the one who made this decision, i should be strong and not rely on him. but i miss him and talking on the computer to him everyday while he's at a&m lets me see the guy that i fell in love with. . especially because he is so nice to me lately. he claims that he's going to wait around for me, and that we will end up together again someday, but im not as sure as he is. i mean, i would love to be his girlfriend if he could treat me better. but we are so far apart, it seems silly of gaining a title of being a girlfriend, but being just as lonely. i need to be on my own for this new experience i am going through, and not attatched to his arm. i need to see who else is out there, this is college for goodness sake. but no matter who i meet, i will always compare them to him. i never thought of it that way, but he was my first love. its weird to imagine that i really was in love, i never thought it could happen. but its very obvious that it was love. but for now i have to be strong, and just keep on the way things are. no matter how much i miss him. because i don't want to get hurt again, not yet, not this far away. im afraid things will just go back to the way they were, and i'll be 10 times more lonely. and its hard enough to meet friends here, there are so many people- i don't need to make it harder by being cooped up in my room all day talking to my boyfriend miles away. this school is funny like that. there are almost too many people to make friends. everyone is doing their own thing, and its really easy to get sucked into hanging out with your old high school friends and not make new friends. but thats not what i came here for. i came here to meet new people, new open minded people, and have new experiences. and to redefine who i am as a person and a friend. but that doesnt mean i have to cut old ties alltogether. hmm. i wonder if its been 20 minutes yet. i think so.

"it's 6:48. i think i'll type up the time as a reference even though there is a timer at the top. as i sit here, looking around and typing without looking at the keyboard, i wonder what my girlfriend is doing since i am using her computer. can't wait till monday!  i finally get my own internet set up at my apartment. i feel like i'm getting sick. i was sneezing a lot the other day, now i have a slight sore throat. i wonder what the purpose of this assignment is. is someone actually going to read this or is it just busy-work?  gah!  i hate this runny nose!  my girlfriend sure has a lot of pictures of me. a little too many?  hope she is getting a good work-out at the gym right now. i need to find more time to go to the gym now. going to the gym everyday for a few minutes isn't that good, right?  wow. i feel like my ex-roommate. all he ever did was study, go to the gym, and hang out with his girlfriend, too. i wonder what i'll do for dinner tonight. i should eat healthier. learning how to actually cook a decent meal might help. i hope i'm doing this assignment correctly. oh well, if i'm not, i can just ask a ta just to make sure. it's only been 6 min and 15 sec?  wow, this is going to be longer than i thought. oh look, it's bloat (a toy from mcdonalds that was in the movie finding nemo). what a great movie that was. best children's movie i've seen in a long time. i'm feeling more ill now. this can't be good. maybe i shouldn't go out tonight. ugh, that's right- i won't be sleeping over tonight either because she cancelled on me so that her friend can sleep over. oh well, i've been spending a lot of time with her recently; it's understandable. i need to find some tissues. there's a roll of paper towels and toilet paper. i think i'll grab some toilet paper. hahaha- it's just like in elementary when we ran out of tissue boxes; the teacher would sometimes have a roll of toilet paper. *sigh*  i miss those good old simple days. a lot less pressure and life was so relaxing back then. it was good to be young. i know what i'd like to do right now!  i want to play counter-strike!  too bad i can't install it onto her computer. i wonder if whoever is going to read this knows who she"""" is. should be obvious, so no worries. what homework'reading assignments do i need to take care of this weekend. hmm, i'm taking care of this psychology writing assignment right now, i still need to do that one experiment (which is being a pain since it keeps running into that error page and i can't go any further!), leb, fin?, maybe a little cms reading?  i think that should take care of it. oh wait- got to do the eco self-homework tomorrow. look, she is back!  aw, she is tired from working out. what?!  she just told me how """"everyone"""" has commented on my latest pictures on her board!  apparently, people think it's a good picture of me. i guess it is. i actually like those pictures of me (which is kind of rare). i wonder if i can type like i do when i'm online- grammatically incorrect!  that would speed up my typing. look!  i'm at 19 minutes now!  19 is a great number. all done now!

"well right now i have to go to the bathroom but i can't because i'm doing my assignment. i am also very hungry i drank an orange juice for breakfast and i didn't eat much for lunch so now food is on my mind. i have to go to my dorm and read a lot because i haven't read anything for any of my classes including psy (oops! should i have written that!??) i also hope that i get a job at bevo's on the drag. i would have to work early in the morning but i really need money right now because i am so broke. i feel awful because of all the expenses my mother has to pay. i just want to help out a bit. i need to go exercising i went to the gym yesterday for about 30 minutes and i went walking for about an hour. i am, trying to lose weight for this  dorm function on the 27th all these girls are going to be in these skimpy bathing suits and usually wear a t-shirt over mine. not this time!! i'm gonna wear a bathing suit without a t-shirt what an accomplishment that will be!! i still have to go to the bathroom. not real bad it's just  like this nagging pain in my bladder (sorry that's kinda gross!) but that's exactly what i'm thinking! my shoulder hurts. it feels sore, my right one. not from typing i think it's from walking last night. it was really weird because my fingers got swollen from all the blood rushing into them while i was walking last night. i felt really good because i was getting lots of exercise. i'm also glad because i quit smoking i  never really started but i smoked 1 then 2,3,4,5,6,7!! and that's when i decided that it was a bad habit and  i didn't want to get addicted. there are some many wonderful things to look forward to lung cancer, smoker's hack, bad breath, smelly clothes and emphysema! besides my mother would kill me before and of those other things got to. my dad smoked and he finally quit. but know he smokes cigars occasionally i told him to quit so now i'm taking my own advice. the minute i finish i going to the bathroom and after that i'm going to go eat  i'm starving' food, food, i want food. after that i'll do my lab, study, take a bath and go to bed. i can't wait!! well i'm not really looking forward to the studying part but that's the reason  i'm here!! well i've come to the end of my twenty minutes so i guess i'll have to say. . adios!!!

"it is friday, which means that school is done for the first week. my classes have gone extremely well. i have calculus, mis, psychology, intro to western music, ba101. my calculus teacher is kind of hard to understand, though. i am also very happy because i have worked out at the gym every day since moving here. i am trying to lose weight and have already lost three pounds. i am also trying to eat better. i run for between 10 to 30 minutes, walk, and do the bicycle machine. the castilian looks like it has delicious food, but since i'm trying to eat healthy, it's kind of hard looking at all the people eating ice cream, pizza, hamburgers. once i get to my goal weight, i am going to allow myself one food treat a week. another reason i am happy is that my email is finally working. it took two hours for a man here to set up my internet. i was on the phone yesterday for like eight hours trying to set up my email. no one seemed to be able to help me. a guy came in today and hooked me up in less than half an hour. now i have a ut account and one with juno. i emailed my dad today, and he wrote back. tonight i hope i do something fun. it is great having a roommate i have been friends with since the sixth grade. we both know when to study and when to have fun. we study every week night and try to go to bed as early as we can. she is in architecture. she is going to be very busy with that. my sister did not go to college. my parents are moving to austin in september. that will be convenient for when i want to see them. the window to our room is open right now and it feels great out. the tower is chiming and i am in a fantastic mood. earlier, when i was in the elevator, the lights turned out for a second and it seemed as though the power was going to turn off. i gasped!  i feel lucky to be able to come to college here to get an excellent education. i hope to have a job i love once i graduate and to be successful. once i get my first job after college i plan on saving a lot of money and also investing. i think about my future a lot. i'm kind of a worrier. i've met some really nice people at the castilian. a lot of the girls here just got finished rushing for their sororities. i didn't do that. i don't think i have time for it as well as how much money it becausets. i was surprised that two of my professors are women and the class i haven't gone to yet is also taught by a teacher. for some reason i felt that a lot of the professors were going to be males. i did not bring a car to school because the car i had was really old. we've had it since before i was born. it's a 1979 toyota corolla. i had a love'hate relationship with it. i loved it because i've known it forever. i hated it because it was so slow and had no radio. i had a yellow jam box in there so i could listen to tapes i made. it got really good gas mileage, though. a lot of people from my home town, temple, go to school here. my roommate's older sister is a sophomore at ut and she stayed at the castilian last year. we requested her room and got it. we face the tower. i forgot to take my vitamin today. i should do that before i go to dinner. i can't wait until i can have a dog. i love dogs. when i was in elementary and middle school i had a yorkshire terrier named candi. she was the cutest little thing!!!  my roommate had a really great mutt the whole time i knew her named charlie. he had to be put to sleep. her family got a new dog who is really stupid named bailey. his parents names were (not joking) terry punky panda and cowboy junkie jow. this dog is literally the stupidest dog i've ever met. he doesn't understand when you don't want him near you. he's chewed up a lot of my roommates stuff at home. both her mom and my dad work for the same company. hopefully this coming summer i can get a job there doing something. i've had a job since i turned 16. well, got to go. i'm going to eat dinner and take a shower for tonight. i am in a great mood!!!!!

"you know i always wonder if i'm ever doing the right thing in life by coming to this university and not going somewhere else. i had opportunities to go to other universities but i chose to stay close to home. my parents always want it there way! they basically chose my major for me and when i wanted to change it, they became upset and really didn't want to see my face which made me upset. i want to do what my parents tell me to do but if it does not interest me and i know i'm going to stress over it, why should i bother to listen and i went with what i felt was best for me and i made the change. i always wonder how some people are so intelligent and others try so much but can't reach the level of that intelligent person based on academics. i see people trying so hard to make that a in that one class where the intelligent person doesn't take one ounce of effort to even study and this person would make a higher grade on the exam then the person who tried so hard to learn the material and study so hard on the exam. one thing which confuses me is how girls think. they're like in their own world sometimes. you try to be so nice to them sometimes and they look at you like you're the biggest idiot! i wish they would open up more around guys and not just talk with their girlfriends all the time. they should be able to tell their guy friends anything they tell their girlfriends. why do the astros suck so bad this year? they had a perfect baseball team and they're playing like a bunch of high school boys. they were recognized as favorites this season and they're ranked last in the division. they're is no excuse for being so mad especially a team so talented like the astros. i mean if you had bagwell, biggio, alou, caminitti and other stars, wouldn't you expect your team to be good?? the rockets need to do better next year also. i can't believe they didn't pick up any free agents this summer. they could have really improved this year with all the talented free agents and they made the mistake of not picking up anyone. if they want to be really good again, they're going to have to pick up some talented free agents or they're not going anywhere and even in danger of not making the playoffs. i don't know why some teachers just don't tell us what will be on the exam. it would be so much easier to study the material but no, they make us study everything even the non important information which really pisses of students, especially me. one thing i really love in the university are the girls. they are so damn hot! only if i could have one of them would i show them what kind of man i really am! its ok, one day, i will find the right one.

"i am so upset with myself today. i am so far behind on my study god i hope i don't fail. i don't want to fail my mom. she would be so disappointed in me. i can't do that to her. class isn't what i thought it would be. and all the reading god, it is so annoying. brooke is pissing me off so much. you would think that since she is five hours away she would make new friends and leave me and lex out of her life. no she has to come down every weekend and steal lex away and get drunk. oh man that is so fun. yeah right. i mean lex is my friend too. i can't spend the weekdays with her because of school and she works till 7:00 every night. then you got homework and early classes. god i just would like to spend one day or hour with her just chilling at the mall or the apartment with her without brooke calling every ten minutes. you have to share lex, brooke. my roommate jana is really cool. she has a great outlook on life. she takes things as they go. i wish i was more like that instead of worrying about everything i do and what people will say. i mean being a girl at ut you have to look pretty to get a guy. so number 1 you must always look good and have makeup on just in case you run into the guys of your dreams. next you have to have good grades or you will flunk out. and why is it when you go to parties it is cool to smoke and drink. sorry i'm not into that. i can have fun without that stuff. jana has this guy she is in to. supposedly he is a charming jerk. he lies to her, yet she can't get enough of him. that is all she talks about. i wish i could find a guy too so we could trade stories. me and jana are not from austin and decided to drive around today to the mall. boy was that stupid. i was so scared i thought we would never find our way back. god i can't get over the fact brooke would intrude into my life this much she is making me so mad. i think i will tell her to stay in arlington and make her own friends, i mean i made mine. i am so bummed. i keep thinking i am going to fail out of college. my brother is a senior here and he is an electrical engineer major while majoring in business too. he was salutatorian in high school and i was only 8th. i am afraid i won't do as well as him and my parents will be ashamed. i mean i have a kinesiology major. that is a joke to everyone i know. i haven't read any of my chapters in my books and am afraid i have a test or quiz tomorrow. i am going to have to cram. i just don't want to fail. i am so scared about this. i know i will fail if i don't straighten my act up but don't have the will to do that. i'm too lazy and tired of school. i just want to go out to the real world"""" now and start my job as a coach and teacher. it would be a lot more easier. i figure if i just concentrate it will be okay, but the problem is i don't have any concentration in me. i feel like i have add (attention deficit disorder). i really don't but it feels like it because i lack so much energy and motivation. i hope school is okay tomorrow because i do not want to have a bad day. i hate bad days they make me sad.

"the timer is already on 15 seconds and i was thinking what to write. i am waiting for my boyfriend nathan to call me because we just talked and he beeped over and said he'd call back. the fan in my room is seriously getting on my nerves because i stripped something in it and it makes a funny vibrating noise. i guess i am nervous about writing this because my foot will not stop tapping. i am so tired. i do not want to go to my nutrition class today. it's the same thing every day and it lasts for an hour and a half. i have so much homework to do also. i just found out that my e-mail in the ut directory is wrong and i have no idea who to contact to change that either. my eyes are drooping so bad. i have so much to do today and just not enough time. i need to finish all my homework, go to class, go to the gym, take a shower before class, and after i go to the gym, and then read a book for my classical mythology class. i'm looking at the timer now and it is only on 3 minutes and 47 seconds. it feels like i've been writing for a lot longer already. i guess i should be lucky to even be on the internet. my dorm, (dobie), has had a lot of problems with ethernet, and this morning (for the second time) when i awoke, my internet would not work. it really sucked. my room is so dirty and i need to clean it. i hate making my bed and waking up to start another long day. my stomach hurts because i ate too much at lunch. the food wasn't really that great today either. i shouldn't have eaten any ice cream. i need to start eating a lot healthier than i have been. i feel bad that i have been cheating on my diet. it was a protein'no carbs diet and at first i did well, but lately i've been cheating. i need to go to wal-mart today to buy a friend of mine a wedding present. i can't beleive she's getting married. i'll probably be the last of my friends to get married. three of the 5 of us are already married. my eyes are soooo tired. i just want to crawl back in bed. i really really wish today were friday. i can't even imagine what next week will be like. after all, the past two weeks have been short weeks. next week is our first full week. i am so ready for this weekend. i am going home and sleeping in my own bed finally. the phone is ringing. it is my boyfriend, nathan. i'm explaining to him that i have to get off the phone because i am doing this assignment. okay he is gone now. i told him to call me back in ten minutes and he said he'd call me back in a little while. that means by the time he calls i'll probably be in my 3:30 class. sometimes he gets on my nerves so bad, but i love him so much. i just feel like he doesn't hardly ever have time for me. it's even harder now that i'm in school. we hardly have time to talk because he's at work from six a. m. to 5 p. m. and i don't get out of class m-f until 5 p. m. by that time both of us have to eat dinner, and i have homework or he has errands to run. sometimes he comes and sees me or i go see him. seguin isn't really that far. but it is an annoying drive. this summer we're supposed to move in together. i almost wonder if we'll still be together then. it makes me sad to even think about us breaking up. he's the best thing that has ever happened to me and i've never been happier. i've also never been sadder sometimes. i guess that's just part of being in an adult relationship. if we live together this summer, we're going to live in san marcos. i wish we could live in austin, but he would have to drive to san antonio every day. oh well. i still have six minutes left to type. i need to call my mom today and see how my family is doing. they came up to see me on sunday, but didn't get to stay long. it really is amazing how our relationship has changed. they finally respect me and give me my own space. before, me and my parents argued all the time. now we actually have phone conversations without even saying one cross word. it's pretty nice. i know it's just because they miss me though. the lights in my room are so annoying. the ones that came affixed to the walls are bright harsh florescent lights. the other ones we bought are sooo bright they hurt my eyes. i guess i'm not going to get to work out today. it's already 12:45 and i still have a lot to do before my three thirty class. i wonder what you guys are going to learn from all this babbling of mine?  to me, i wouldn't see anything interesting about a bunch of kids rambling on about their thoughts. damn my typing needs work. i used to be a great typist, now i have to backspace a million times to get it right. it's terribly annoying. i think after i'm done with this i might sign up for my experiments for this class. i did the pretest the other day. it took way longer than i expected. my arms and hands are getting tired of typing. i can't wait until this is over. only 48 more seconds. that fan is still making that stupid noise, and my suitemate just got home. she always slams the door. i really need to clean my room and i guess i will in about 5 seconds. okay well bye for now. i'm not going to finish my writing now that my 20 min. are up. i've got lots of other things to do today. bye ",1
"i want money. i like money. what is the easiest way to get it?  winning the lottery is too hard. maybe i can get a wish to come true. a wish. where do wishes come from?  i hear you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun, but what is a leprechaun, little guys, red hair, beards?  where would one find a leprechaun?  if i found one, how could i catch it?  it must be fast, or everyone would catch them and get wishes. they must live in scotland, or ireland because of the red hair and accent- i wonder if they drink. a drunk leprechaun. funny,  the life of the party. granting wishes for everyone. what wish do i want?  what else?  money, happiness  power?  power is good. maybe i could have enough power to order someone elses death, or prevent it. i could rule the world, like everyone wants to deep down inside. or maybe i don't. i just want to sit back in the country somewhereand be by myself, maybe witha family. two kids. maybe some livestock to get money with. invest it  live off interest. that sounds good. i could stopgoing to school, go home, and sleep for a while. sleep. sleep is good. i like sleeping. but the time goes faster when i sleep. do i want to go faster?  no?   yes?  maybe?  definitely maybe. i don't want to miss anything, but i want to skip ahead to a more relaxing part of my life. i'm too lazy to have to work for a living. i don't know how i'm going to get through it. all of this studying. hasnt gotten me anywhere yet. but i only just started. preparing for my future. the future is a fantastic place. it can be whatever we make it, but that will be a bad place, if i know what i'm talking about. people die. kill eachother. why? to what end?  everyone dies. what difference does it make when?  i would prefer to die later in my life, though. i guess i want to wait and see what comes of me, in the end. in the next millenium. nostradamus says the world will end. soon. i want to see if it happens. that would be something to tell the grandkids about. the end of the world. not everything would die. that can't happen. life goes on. not as it is known, but in some form. a science teacher of mine once said that fire ants would inherit the earth. as long as its well after i'm dead, i don't care who has it. the world will fend for itself, unless we destroy it before we destroy eachother. its a race to see who wins, but no one will. a race to the edge of a cliff. media tells us its not coming,  they make a road for us to race on, and fun buildings along the sides, they tell us there's no cliff, that were running towards an open pasture full of wildflowers and pretty white bunnies. but i know the cliff is there. thats something else i want to se before i die, or as i die. will the world survive?  will man kill the earth first, or will man kill man first?  one way, nothing survives. the other way, the earth survives, and possibly a few men, to carry on the race. i know who i'm rooting for. i want man to get to that cliff and go right off. unless it can slow down, or run a different direction, but for now, the cliff. but that should be after i'm gone. i don't have to worry about anything. if only i could catch that damn leprechaun.

"     i really don't know what to write about. it is funny when you try to think about what you are thinking about and you can't seem to find anything in your head. my friend is talking to his girlfriend. typing is a lot harder than i remember. september 11th is coming up and i hear patriotic music in the background. my drive back to austin today was very hard. it rained the whole way down here so instead of the usual three hour drive it turned into nearly four hours. my band practiced very well this weekend. we put in about four hours of practice. our show this weekend was cancelled so instead we decided to practice. we did a little recording in my guitar player's garage. i stayed up very late yesterday just talking to some friends online. i had a huge burrito from chipolte. i had never been there before so it was a surprise to see a burrito that big; however, i didn't really enjoy it because they put onions and peppers in it. i suppose it was my fault, because i told them what to put in it. i said i wanted fajita chicken and then started putting peppers and onions in the burrito. i thought the fajita part was the way the cooked the chicken. it turns out it was just the stuff they put in with the chicken. i didn't eat much of it, but i will still give the place a second chance. now i know not to order that kind of burrito. my parents took my girlfriend and her friend out to dinner on friday night. we went to chili's off of f. m. 3040. after that we went to my girlfriend's house and just played the piano. we played for about two hours. i figured out how to play two new songs. one was a spanish song and the other was carol of the bells. we had no music, we were just going by ear. my girlfriend's friend was getting very annoyed because she did not want to play the piano. instead she played cards with my girlfriend's family. studying for college has not been going the way i would like it. i told myself i would stay caught up with all of my classes, but i seem to have fallen behind already with all of them. i just need to concentrate and read like a mad man. dave matthews keeps running through my ears and i can't get the lyrics from entering.   how can i turn away. brother sister go dancing.   i went to two of his concerts this year. they were a blast. there were so many fans yelling and screaming. the atmosphere was so pleasant. he played a few of my favorite songs and i nearly cried. the university of oklahoma football game was very interesting. they almost lost. i was so excited with two minutes left in the game and oklahoma trailing alabama by three points. unfortunately ou won. they also, unfortunately lost their quarterback with a torn acl. texas got off to a bad start although they managed to keep the eagles from scoring. it looked like the ut offense was about to fall apart in the second half. next week should be a thriller in north carolina. abc will be on nonstop in my dorm room. my mom is calling. she wanted to make sure i got home safely. i am glad to be here with most of friends although i do have friends that are not with me. my girlfriend for one is back in dallas and every chance i get i go back and see her. i wish she was here with me and then it wouldnt be so hard and i wouldn't waste as much gas. twenty minutes has ended.

"at 855 i should be done writing this paper!!! i am so excited that i get to go home and see my man today. so my body really hurts right now but i feel great because i have worked out every day for like the past week and now i think i am addicted to working out. it gives me such a rush and whoa!!!!! someone just slam their door and it scared the hell out of me. i hat when people slam their doors it is so frustrating. we have designated quiet hours in the dorm and there they go again!!! no one ever follows those quiet hours lalalala i really feel like dancing i think it would be cool it is funny how my typing can't keep up with my thoughts so in essence all i can think about it the typing of this paper and how sad it is that i have to do it for 20 minutes which i originally thought would be a short period of time but i look at the clock right now and it says 420 which means it is time to smoke. lol that is if i smoked weed which i don't i actually find that to be so stupid. why do you have to smoke or drink anything to feel good about life. sounds like a lame excuse of trying to cover some sort of problem you have. psychology is such an interesting major. i just got to find a minor for rotc and actually rotc seems, surprisingly, like it will be a lot of fun! i am so ready to prove to myself and to everyone else that i can cut it i just hope i maintain my gpa and can be like what now! i love the idea of pushing myself to achieve something because once i finish it is the best feeling kind of like the """"high"""" i get when i exercise i need to call my mom and tell her to pick up some water at that case lot sale i am excited to be going home to see my b'f but i really don't want to see my family that is probably the one thing i don't miss all that arguing i can't wait to graduate from college one thing that scares is me is my relationship with my man. he is older i know and i do love him or at list i think i love him and i would never want to hurt him , but i am scared about settling down after college for so many years i saw college as being the perfect time to party and meet boys, but now it isn't like that i love to flirt but i have someone that cares about me and that i care about but i just don't know to i want to settle down with someone that doesn't even have a high school diploma. i'm scared he's going to end up using me or something stupid like that. i know that is mean but so far he doesn't keep his promises to me and he lies and i pay for everything but it doesn't matter he  will pay me $200 i think i have spent over $1000 on our relationship. going out to eat and the movies and just things like that and it sucks. oh well that is life goodness this is the longest 20 minutes of my life i am starting to get typer's cramp. is that possible? well staring at this screen sure isn't helpful at all!! i am so hungry and want to go downstairs and get food but first i have to wait to finish this paper then i got to go get my laundry and put it into the dryer so this could take awhile. i wonder what i'm going to wear i want to wear my brown shoes but do i have anything natural colored to go along with it i have my green shirt my stripped one is dirty hmm i really should look would white go ummm i need to paint my toenails!!! i can so do that when i get back from eating actually i think naw i do them when i get back look only 3 and a half more minutes i think my roommate is back nope someone else i wonder where she is because her class got out at 9 but normally she comes back early. i really hope i make the crew team i think that would be so cool. i want to make a team and feel special just something else to tell myself that i can do it everyone keeps saying because i am tall but it will be a whole new experience because i know nothing about the sport man i need to brush my teeth what can wear damn i got to remember my list to take home call the court got to ad that to the list so many things to do this weekend i think i'm going to take summer courses yay! almost finished 3. 2. 1 ",0
"i hate it when you get so confused and you don't know what to think about anything. sometimes you think you are making the right decision but then you start to doubt yourself. i guess i tend to do that a lot lately. i never know if what i am doing is right or not. will it work in the long run? oh well. school gets to be confusing but i guess that is at least something  that is relatively constant. i don't think i deal that well with change. but i am not so sure anyone really does. things tend to be uncertain a lot more that a lot of people like to  admit. the only thing that i know for sure is that no one person stays the same no matter how much they would like  things to. personally, i have always thought that it is possible to care or even love more than one person at the same time. i am not sure why or when monogamous  relationships came around but i am not exactly sure they work. i actually have a lot of proof, just look at the divorce rate. but i guess that is not really proof of anything except for the fact that people have given up forgiving other people for their mistakes. everything changes schools, and people and everything else. when you see people that you have known a long time in a different setting, why does everything seem so weird. some of them seem nicer others have changed so much that you can't even recognize who they are. anyway, i am really tired of thinking about this. computers can really get so annoying. i realize that they are supposed to be a good thing but they can be really confusing too. i guess everything really is. i am getting really tired of talking to myself or at least that is how i feel i wonder what draws certain people to certain things. like what makes me like  the color pink and someone else absolutely detest it?  my next question is  why do i put things off?  i guess because i don't like to admit to myself that i actually have work to do. plus i guess i am just plain lazy. there's nothing like having a few really close friends but then that can be a bad thing too. but another problem is when you have a group of friends, and of course if there are guys and girls in the group as there normally one of them becomes attracted to another and of course that can become a huge problem. the worst thing is that if something does happen between those people then it will eventually seriously affect the  rest of the group. la la la!!! i feel so retarded right now and my time is up. so i guess this is goodbye. at least until i do my next righting assignment.

"     well i finally found the website for this place, and now im not really sure what to say. im sitting at my desk, and my room seems really warm. im also very angry at my roommate katie right now. sometimes she just isnt very considerate of other peoples feelings. i signed up for an experiment thing in my csd class, and i have no idea where the room is! all it said was totten and the time and i have no idea what that means. i hope my teacher explains it closer to the time. oh i also have to sign up for the experiment for this class too. i almost forgot! the ink on my hand is already wearing off, i should go write down the time on paper when im done with this. i really like the class though, except my teacher is boring. but its cool because i want to major in communications. the lady from there never called me back! i should call her again soon. well maybe i can get the application online or something. i wonder whats going on with the guys next door. they're always coming over here to say hi. i think im going to ask vinay if he wants to do his calculus homework with me! hes pretty smart, and maybe he can help me. poor kris. i can't believe hes sick now because of me! i hope hes feeling better. this chair is really nice! yesterday was pretty scary, i get really nervous about stuff like that. the bells at the tower were really pretty though when they were playing god bless america. i guess its a pretty historical moment, and im glad i was here for that. even though this wasnt my first choice i guess its ok. its kind of big, but maybe i need that. wow its been 8 minutes already. i don't know if this is due by 5 today. wait what is today. ok i ha 3 classes so its thursday and oh ok sept 13. thats tomorrow. this is crazy. i should get started on that map too. i wonder who will be analyzing this, or if it even gets analyzed. yeah i bet it does. why else would i be writing it. i think it said it was going to give me a printout of what i wrote and something else too. an analysis? i don't think a computer could do that. wow tomorrow is friday already yay i get to see all my friends back home! i have to go see peter and see how forbidden gardens is! he said hes still going to work there until the end of the year i think. i wonder what college he'll end up going to. he could get into princeton, i hope he does. if not hs coming to ut so that'll be cool. uh i can't believe this morning! im so mad at her! i wonder when shes getting back! should i act mad or just let it go? its probably better if i tell her. yeah i will. i think its bad to keep your emotions bottled up inside for a long time, or at all. simply type continuously tracking your thoughts and feelings for the entire 20 minutes. i guess im doing that. kind of just whatever pops into my head. oh feelings. wasnt i supposed to write about my surroundings too. i hate messing up and having to backspace! well i still feel warm, but not as much, it was probably because i had just gotten home and had walked outside a lot. i wonder what chapter im supposed to be on for this class. oh man chapter 2. ok well i have 1 done so that shouldnt be too hard. those notes took me forever! i need to think of a faster way. well i could highlight like in my geography book, but i think i might want to keep my psychology book maybe for future reference or something. i hope nothing happens today! thats just really scary, and who was it that told me that something would probably be hit today since everyone expected it yesterday. its hard to type out all my feelings because i think faster than i type, so as soon as i think something, i start typing, but then my thoughts switch, so a lot isnt being recorded. plus i think my mind doesnt complete thoughts all the time, so maybe im not really recording exactly how i think. hmm. gosh im hungry. that breakfast was really good this morning! i thought it was going to be weird since i went down there by myself but everyone was there by theirselves. thier theirselves. that doesnt look right. hey i have 45 seconds left. uh! as soon as i finished writing that the time was already off. this is annoying. ok well i guess im almost done, this was pretty cool, it will be interesting to see what i actually wrote nonstop for 20minutes.

"well, since my friend just told me how she neglected to get us these free random  glow in the dark condoms, i've got sex on the brain, not that i've even had sex before. it's just one of those things that jumps in my head two or three times a day. i think it's because it's one of those unknown things i haven't experienced yet. i really wish i was back at home sitting on my bed, with my dog at my feet, waiting for my brother to come in and keep me up talking about my poor relationship problems which i still to this day haven't figured out. i miss him, my boyfriend' friend' player' love or whatever. all i know is that i had fun with him no matter what was going on in my life. he could and still can always make me laugh. i miss that. i just plain miss him. and i'm not saying that i never once thought of having sex with him but it was never a real issue. he made me smile and never upset me. well, that's not completely true. sometimse he upset me but it wasn't his fault. unfortunately, i loved him a lot more than he loved me even though he really and truly loved me a lot. sometimes  i wonder if he is gay. i know that sounds odd but maybe   . no forget it. i'n so exhausted and all i want to do is go to sleep in my own bed under a real homy roof. i know it sounds funny becaouse they're probably all asleep but i wonder what they're doing- my family and john and my other long lost friends who off at some far away college. poor jonathan is out at sea. i hope it's not raining on him. the food here is good but i don't like having some one tell me when i have to eat and when i can't. there is no refrigerator with blue bell stuffed in the back. and most of all, there is no arlington dance academy. oh, guys i wish i was there to teach my little kids and have them run up and hug my leg. i wish i had my senior class back cause i have so many great ideas from new pop songs i've heard here in austin. why can't i just skip the whole college thing. i know ican do it and i have the abiltiy and the committment to finish, ijust don't think i need to . i want to run a dance studio  . i need to be going to conventions and new york and watching my previous dance instructor run the agenda and show me the accounting not learning about some stupid coorporations that i'll never want a job from or need an interview from. i just want to do what i've been doing best for the last 15 years and that is choreograph real dance in my own studio with my own ideas and expectations. it's my dream and its getting away from me. school seems second now and i really don't care. i've put it first most of the rest of my life. i did my 18 years now i want my career, my dream. i still want to dance myself but that is possible except not here in austin where most of the studios are for elementary and the directors are real snots. people should want you to dance with them especially if you have a good attitude. but my bed is calling to me and i still have some very important e-mails to take care of. it's so nice to know that some people care enough at least to type.

"well i decided that i was going to go ahead and get this writing assignment out of my way. actually, i was just looking for an excuse to put off my reading for my mis course. i really dread reading that whenever i am finished with this because it is like 30 something pages long and i already have a bad headache. it's pounding as we speak. (or should i say as i type!) wow, my nose itches a whole bunch. but i guess i would rather it itch than run. earlier today i was on my way back to the dorms and allergies kicked in really bad. i hope i am not getting sick. that would really suck. i am really excited and nervous all at once about this weekend. i can't wait to see devin. i haven't seen him in like two weeks and it is probably going to be like a month before i get to see him again. he had his first baseball game today, i wonder how he did. did he start? did he hit well? i can't wait to talk to him tonight and get all the details. i'm excited about watching him play on saturday. baseball is his true love and i am really happy that he gets to fulfill his dreams by playing in college. however, i hate the idea of having to come home early on sunday. my reasons for coming home are good, but i just wish i could spend more time in dallas with him and not have to rush back. i mean, why does the dance team tryouts have to be this weekend of all weekends. every other weekend that i have been here i have tried hard to find excuses and things to do and have had no luck at all except for staying out late and partying. i honestly wanted something productive to do. but now that i have decided to go out of town, they decide to hold dance team tryouts. and that would be what makes me nervous. i have always seemed to accomplish my goals and dreams, especially in the field of dance. but now i am going to be up against so many good girls and i just don't know what to do about that. i really hate the idea of rejection, but if i don't try then i'd never even know what would have came of it. jennifer is trying out too and it's going to be horrible living with someone who makes it if she does and i don't. gosh, i really am nervous. what if they don't like my style or technique. i will be really depressed if i don't make it. i get embarrassed about stupid stuff like this. i wonder why that is. it shouldn't matter what happens, no one should care but me, but somehow i feel ashamed when i don't make things that i go out for. so i just finished balancing my checkbook and i really could use some more money. sure mom and dad are paying for everything, but it would be nice to go out and do what i want to do when i want to do it and not have to rely on them. speaking of money, my tuition bill says that i owe $178 and that is so not true. everything was paid and up to date and then i just decided yesterday to add a ballet course. however, the ballet course is only $59,,that is so not equal to $178. i wonder how long i have been writing for. oh wow, it has already been 10 minutes! how come exercising doesn't seem to go this fast. i feel like when i am running on the treadmill that i have been going for like 15 minutes and it is actually only like 2 minutes or so. that's crazy. i shouldn't have ran the other night. my legs are so sore now and walking up and down these hills many times a day hasn't felt good on these sore muscles. not to mention, i have had 2 dance classes since then and it is really hard to be limber and flexible when you are this sore. now my lip itches. this music on television is horrible. i would get up and change the channel but i obviously cannot do that due to this assignment. i am starting to wonder about this course. the lectures are really interesting and class is fun. i have kept up with the readings and understood it for the most part. but when it comes down to it, will i really be able to make good grades on the tests that are compiled of both the readings and the lectures. that sort of makes me nervous. the professor is really good and easy to listen to and understand, but i still seem to think that his tests will not so much be the same way. i have a feeling they will be very insightful and difficult and that stresses me out. i've come from a background of like all a's and i do realize things are going to be much harder now that i am in college, but i am not used to making much lower than an a. i am getting really sick of staring at this screen and my fingers are starting to cramp. my position is not very comfortable and i haven't moved in like 15 minutes. it is nice to have peace and quiet in here for once. my roommate seems to not care or respect me much. she likes to do what she wants to do and how and when she wants to do it. and that is fine and all, but when i am trying to sleep i think it's just a little rude when she comes in at like 5 in the morning and is all slamming doors and turning on lights, talking on the computer and on the phone! it's like, i haven't been sleeping very well as it is being in a new environment and all for the first time for this long of a time, then i finally get to sleep and she comes in and wakes me up. then it takes me like another 30 minutes to fall back to sleep. gosh i really hate that, but we have been friends for a long time and what do you say to someone like that? i wonder what my mom and dad are doing. i wish i could find amanda's keys or at least find out what happened to them. i mean i just find it so awkward that they just disappeared. my dorm room is not that big and i can't seem to find them anywhere. i feel horrible about her having to take $165 out of her own check book to get an extra key made. everytime i think about it, i start to get the idea that maybe i accidentally threw them away whenever i took at the trash. i'm thinking about sending her a check with part of the money because i feel so bad for her! gosh this music on tv is horrible! i like one of her songs, but she just sounds horrible in concert. i don't know how much longer of this i can stand. my shoulders are starting to bother me. it doesn't help out that they were sore to begin with. oh, something's popping up. i'm through!

"it is now eleven o'clock and i'm getting hungry for lunch. i don't know why i'm hungry, i just ate a couple of hours ago. i really wish i didn't get hungry so often. sometimes i think i'm not really hungry, but i just like eating. i'm not overweight, but i really haven't felt good about my body for a couple of months now because i've been away and too busy to go to the gym as often as i used to. i'm worried that when i go back home to california in a couple of months for thanksgiving people are going to think i've gained weight. when i go back i want to look good, even better than when i left. i can't wait to go home, well actually, i can. i know when i get home i'm going to wish that i was still back here. my dorm room is already starting to feel like home to me. i was really upset that joe didn't call last night. it's been over two weeks since i talked to him last and he had promised to call the next day. i don't even have his phone number so there's no way i can reach him. i swear, that boy drives me mad!  oh, well, i'm not going to think about him any more. i'm really glad to finally be doing this assignment. i've been meaning to but my computer isn't set up so it's been impossible to do. i am so frustrated with this whole ethernet thing. i've been to the store so many times and they never have the part i need. finally i thought about using the computer lab here in kinsolving. it's really nice as a matter of fact. it feels good to be on a computer again. i miss mine from home even though i wasn't on it very much. i wonder if anyone will ever really read this paper. i think i would laugh at half the stuff i've written. i don't know why i'm telling you these things, you don't even know, or care, who joe is or that i have a computer. this place just got really full, it's weird how people seem to come in clumps. have you ever noticed that at places there will be no line and then all the sudden there's a huge long line? that's weird, i think. i miss my dog. he died this summer while i was away in germany. i just wish i'd given him more attention when i was home. i knew he would die some day, but i just never thought it would be so soon. i miss the meyers. that's the family i was with in germany. they were so nice to me, i felt like part of the family. not many people get to do all the cool stuff i've been blessed enough to experience. i love to travel, but it's always so nice to be home. i was never bored this summer. that's a first for me. i'm almost always bored. i didn't get any letters today. that's the first time i haven't gotten any since i've been here. it kind of sucks. sorry for swearing, i don't usually swear. i still have ten minuets to write. i'm running out of things to say. you must be so bored by now. someone is playing music in the lobby. it's really annoying me. i can't wait to go to sleep tonight. why am i always so tired. i don't even care if i go out anymore. i'm so jealous of my roommate. she is always doing cool stuff with her sorority and i haven't done much yet. she's really cute. i love her curly hair. we tried to make mine curly but it was more of a wave. it looked good, but i didn't know what other people would think about it. i just realized people could e-mail me down here  that's good because people have been bugging me for my address. i can't wait until my computer is running. i'm so excited for the football game on saturday, i just hope it's not too hot. i hope we beat ucla because a lot of my friends are going there and i know that they'll think of me when they see ut and i want them to be jealous that the longhorns won. that's bad that i want them to be jealous. it's not really what i want, i just want them to think of me. it would be really neat if i could get on tv then they could see me here and know that i'm okay and having fun. i really am having fun, but it sounds so fake when i tell people that, like i'm just pretending or something. ljliujiojkl ",0
"i have so many things to do and not enough time. i feel like i am taking on too much. i know i can handle it if i get past these first few weeks, but right now i feel overwhlemed. i am stressed out with all the reading i have to do. i am such a slow reader and it takes so much effort for me to concentrate and take notes. i know though that i am a good notetaker and if i take the time i should do well in my classes. i am just too tired and stressed right now. i wish i could be at home where no one would come in to bug me or try to use my things and my computer. i am so frustrated with my roommates using my computer. it is new and i am worried they will mess something up. if i make it through till next tuesday i will be ok. this weekend will be fun though so i just need to relax for once and enjoy it. i miss my family when i get stressed out like this. i keep telling myself""""if i can only make it till december. """" it is not that i dislike ut. i like my schedule and my professors, but it is just so different. i know this will be one of my hardest semesters, so with god's help, i will make it through just fine. i just need to relax and enjoy it. i am so determined to make a very good gpa this semseter that i hope i am not dissapointed. the scholarship requirements are good because it gives me a reason to work for them. actually, i think it scares me more than it helps. i want to make good grades for myself. the scholarship makes me afraid of failure. i am such aperfectionist that i hate failure. i am determined to make a good gpa within my 15 hours. i want to prove everyone wrong who tells me i should have taken 12. if i took 12 i would be in summer school forever. i know i can handle it because i did so much in high school that i am prepared forit. i also don't care if people make fun of me for studying too much. it will payoff when they do bad this semester. i think i just need a break. i am caught up in my reading, but i need a week without 10 different activities for me to do. i just have to have confidence in myself that i can do it and things will get easier as the semester goes on. i felt so good though last night when i got 2 dates. maybe i will meet some great guy while up here. i was beginning to have my doubts. i am excited about football season beginning. it should be fun to see all the college games. i love college football. i hope we do well this year. i feel like i am running out of things to babble about. or that all i have done it repeat myself over and over. i guess it doesn't matter as long as i write what i am feeling. all i  hope is that i get everything finished early so that i can go to sleep early tonight. i think i will be able to do that. well, maybe tomarrow will be a better day. i can't wait till there is nothing going on that i have to go out for. i am sure next week will be better.

"i just completed the pretesting survey. sigh, things like that make absolutely no sense to me. i can never decide exactly where i stand, and i can never define myself with the choices provided. always have to compromise who i am. i always end up generalizing all of those qualities i have fought tooth and nail to keep. starting college has been such a weird experience. a room full of people, but i am still alone, a street full of people, but i am on my own, a world full of people, i have nobody but myself. i am glad the ball has started to roll. college is beginning, and, so far, there have been no horrid surprises, i have not been ambushed by a detail i have overlooked. i now have to gauge the speed of that ball, and plan my life around it. i need to visit my family this weekend. that is a drag, i am just beginning to form this new life, just starting to assemble my new identity, and i have to disassemble everything, and hide it in the closet. family, sigh, the wonderful thing about family is you are sentenced to being around people who you probably will never get along with. parents are even funnier. you are sentenced to respect and obey these people you probably will never get along with. i bet you are assuming i don't get along with my family, that we fight all the time. right and wrong. i don't get along with my family, the key word is i. the person they think i am gets along with them perfectly. we haven't fought in 2 years, that was the last time i tried to be myself around them. then i realized that i had to either bullshit them and survive, or go down in history. so here i am, mr. bullshit. sigh. sometimes i wonder where the bullshit ends and i begin. i stopped wondering about that a while ago. it was too hard to tell. i hate every person who is in my life right now. my roommates are ok, but immature. my girlfriend, that's right, girlfriends, are not compatible with me, but i am not willing to give up having sex, to be perfectly honest with them. at least not until i can find somebody i get along with, and can have sex with. i don't know why i place so much importance in sex, but that is all i can think of when i see a slightly attractive woman. i feel so evil sometimes, but i am sure my parents would be proud. i might be a depraved heathen, but at least they taught me how to bury myself under selfguilt. good for them. this is the end of the twenty minutes; i need to go get my laundry out of the dryer now. until next time. ciao.

"okay for 20 minutes hopefully it will go by relatively fast. i have so much to do today studying, and going to workout will probably consume the rest of my day. but i am finally settling into a routine, it's taken a couple of weeks but i am getting the hang of college life. most of my friends are going home for the weekend but it's too soon for me. i want to stay, besides i went to dallas last weekend for labor day for my sister's birthday. i got to see my best friend zach who is now in colorado trying to wrestle. but i am not anxious to go home just yet, especially since i will there the first weekend of october for txou and the santana concert. then later that month my mom and my sisters will be coming to see me here at school. my oldest sister maggie is bringing her new fiance. i haven't met him yet, but he must be a good guy if she has chosen to marry him she of all people would not stand to be burnt twice. they both have to go get annulments from their previous marriages so they can be wed in a catholic church. catholicism is kind of funny that way i come from a very strong catholic family and my father would rather have preferred me to attend the university of dallas which is catholic and not liberal ut. however, my parents strategically placed my in dobie, next to the university catholic center. smart people. little do they know the last time i went to church was when i was in dallas. my dad also really pushes me to become a doctor which is what i have wanted to do for the majority of my life. but last spring, architecture was really introduced to me and now i am in dean speck's architecture class which is fascinating i love it. who knows when i'll figure out what i want to do, i do have the feeling that no matter what i decide to do that i'll probably endure some sort of midlife crisis and completely change my career. but that's okay with me, there are a lot of people who do that. my sister jennifer, for example, is 29 and is about to take her lsat and apply to law school. she is even applying to ut law that would be cool if she was down here too. i like being on my own though and not really having the responsibility of worrying about her. it's not that she places that responsibility on me but i am the closest to her out of my family so i am usually the one in the middle trying the best way to help her alcoholism and depression. yeah, she's applying to law school. at least she has some sort of direction. it's hard for her to hear the truth. but i slammed it down her throat this summer and i think it hit her. i wonder when kim is getting home. i think she said 5:00. i like having the whole suite to myself though i can actually get some stuff done. we have to go later to the house and put in some study hours with reese. reese is probably lonely without jessica around to bug her. i hope i get her as my diamond sister, that would be really cool. kim is going home this weekend along with the rest of the world to see dave matthews band one of my favorites. i have seen them in concert before and tickets are expensive so i don't think i am going to go. unless my boyfriend can find some relatively good priced lawn tickets not likely. i'd like to see everyone then again it's too soon to come home. i miss my dog. it took me 17 years to get a dog and i finally get the most perfectly adorable black lab and i leave for school. i'll probably breed labs when i'm older i love labs and i don't see why i'd ever have any other kind of dog. my suitemates are really organized i am typing on amy's computer and i'm noticing how clean her desk isooh, i'm done!

"my life is an out of control freight train. i know not where i am going or how i am going to get there. throw a match upon me and i could combust or possibly extinguish the flame, which you so eagerly tried to ignite. but for what reason do you do this? i hold the answer to so little, so it is to you that i pass the question. why am i all of the sudden asking myself why? i know where i came from but does this mean i cannot know where i am going? on i travel into the world unknown, uncontrolled by arms of mythic proportions. this gyroscope of time has hurled many an uncertain soul into its path with unrelenting mercy. this is why i am grateful that i do not have to face the world alone. my life is full of love and hope. my hopes of myself are to touch some person the way i have been inspired by many a magnificent soul. this ring of stupidity, which we call life, is taking place in a common fashion and i can see through your blurry sight. and i can see through you! your rules mean nothing to me and mine. i live a life of loyalty, true to myself and my own. i draw so much upon my music that i sometimes misinterpret fiction for fact. my life is one long song, sung by the most gifted beings.

"it is 1:39pm and i have decided to use my break between classes to tackle this writing assignment. i am not even in my dorm because my we ordered my computer and it hasn't come in yet. i am typing this from my friend's computer. she lives two doors down from me at the dobie center. life is a really funny thing because it is so unpredictable. for example, three weeks before school started i was in a really bad car wreck. in the accident i broke my patella from the impact of my knee crashing against the dash. i have been in a brace to immobilize my knee and crutches ever since. so now i have to crutch around campus. it's terrible. i am having a really hard time writing this paper because there are no rules or criteria. i absolutely hate having no outline, it drives me crazy. i am the kind of person that needs very specific and detailed guidelines. otherwise i panic because i not sure if i am doing is exactly what is expected. my classes so far seem really fun. all of my professors are really interesting and down to earth. my one concern is on monday because i have two classes back to back that are on opposite sides of campus. i can't believe that i am on my own. my parents have been such a major part of my life because of snow skiing injury. my freshman year of high school i hit a tree while skiing and broke my femur. the brake went through my growth plate so i had major complications. i was completely dependent on my parents for everything. i couldn't walk, carry things, or even sleep through the nights. i've had 8 surgeries on my leg and i have been homebound from school for half of a semester. when i was homebound i had so much time to think about anything and everything. the main thing that i concentrated on when i was home was learning how to roll with the punches. i am an extreme perfectionist, which makes me very uptight about every little detail. most people would assume that it is a good quality to be a perfectionist, but i beg to differ. a perfectionist gets so overwhelmed by the tiny mistakes that he forgets to look at the big picture. as a perfectionist your job is never finished because there is always something that could be improved. it's a terrible quality, it really is. my roommate is not really a perfectionist, but she is a neat freak so that is good. i am so lucky that i got paired up with such an awesome roommate. her name is lorie, and i love her to death. its almost like we are the same person. we hit it off right from the start. what i like about college is that you aren't penalized for being yourself. in high school i was often accused of being fake. sorry that i am a really friendly girl and i try to get along with everybody. college is such a big step in life, i feel like i am starting a new life almost. my three fiends from home are going to school here and they have an apartment at melrose. i feel like they are my family now. they are three really great guys that i graduated with. i make sure their house stays clean and their schoolwork is taken care of. in return they make sure i am taking care of my knee and that i don't get too stressed out. it is such a warm feeling to know that someone cares about you. i think it is so important to show someone that you love them everyday, and to know that you are loved everyday. i was raised in a very affectionate family so that is what i am used to and what i need to get me through each day. well the timer just went off, twenty minutes is up. i look forward to a great semester with you.

"well to begin. i don't like spelling. you make me check my spelling but what i really want to do is just permanently change the way things are spelt. or make everyone think they way i do. wow wouldn't that be nice. hum to have everyone think the same as me. no not really. if everyone thought the same as me it would be one boring world. """"so andr'a how goes your thoughts on abortion?"""". response: """"i don't know. why don't you ask yourself. """". well i bet that isn't how the conversation would go. cause the other person wouldn't think they thought like me they would think i think like them. so about the only conflict would come up as to who is the original """"who"""". but how about it we took different situations and then gave everybody my opinion?. but that is a lot of work. and i don't feel like that. speaking of no feeling like working. i don't feel like working. hehe you don't know it but i just misspelled feel. i wrote fell instead. lets think about that. if a cow falls in a hole how would it get out. i guess you would have to build stairs huh. no not really you could just pull the damn thing out. damn cows way in the world are they even falling in holes. don't they know not to do shat like that? oh yeah like that little baby. who was it?. oh baby jessica(i think). wouldn't suck to fall in a hole? heheh. i was watching a movie the other day(big big movie buff) called """"cecil b. demented""""  it was a great movie. one guy in the movie(he is from another movie called """"drive me crazy""""(don't ever see that one). but in this movie he is a drug addict. not the scary kind that look like skeletons and shat but the funny kind that take every kind of drug. back to my point. at one point he is trying to run away but he is running in place. his excuse you ask. he's stuck in a kb hole. hehehe. i think its funny even if you aren't laughing. you ever think about that. when i write something on the computer it just doesn't laugh. damn computer. doesn't have a sense of humor. perhaps if i ripped all its cords out it would be laughing. """"hahahahaha"""". no no not really. that is mean. hum. new topic okie. i like to look around and see how everybody has their own style. some like to wear tight clothes some wear funky stuff. if people have an """"outgoing"""" style does that mean they are caught up in unimportant things such as outer beauty?. no not at all. people often like to dress up. in that fun sort of way. or they like to do stuff like that. alright i'm bored of this conversation. really i am. sam i am. i will not eat green eggs and ham. oh poor dr. seuss. he's six feet under. man i saw part of the emmys last week. they shown all the movie stars who had died. sniff. yi think a nice thing to paint is reflections. they are really pretty. i have a lot of stuff to do. ugh. the word stuff is so slang. (said in a valley girl way. ) """"that word was just like so slang"""" (nose pointed up and with a quick twist she leaves the room). i think i should start saying something else besides """"stuff"""". """"i have a lot of things to do"""". """" i have many things to do"""". """"my agenda is full right now can you call back at a later date and then maybe we can set something up for you. no. no sir you don't understand my calendar runs out after october and i won't be getting a new one for at least another week. so i'm going to need you to call back to set up the appointment. alrighty sir. you have a nice night. bye"""" (click) """"y'all come back now you hear"""". buh  ",0

"yesterday i went to my brother's football game. he is in 7th grade and is the quarterback of the team. i was really proud of him even though they lost 200. my brother's name is jason and he is also in the rotc program at his school (mendez middle school). i've always admired him for his ability to go out and achieve his goals. even though he may be scared, he'll try something new. i wish i had his courage and strength. i could never try anything new at least not on my own. sometimes when things get to hectic for me, i can turn to my brother and i know everything is going to work itself out. my brother is the only boy in a family with three older girls and people have a hard time understanding our closeness to one another, especially my boyfriend. until he met me he never knew that a brother and a sister could get along so well or have some kind of bond to each other. my brother's friends sometimes tease him about the relationship that he has with me, they'll say """"it's not normal"""" or """"ya'll are weird"""". but we don't let it bother us because sometimes we fight like cats and dogs but we can't stay mad at each other for long. onetime on a tv show or a movie, i can't remember but anyway this lady made a comment that brother and sisters could not like each other, it was not sane or normal. he would wait up for me when i would come back from a date or he could not go to sleep until i did. we are five years apart and yet it seems like we are the same age. we both like the same things and keep each other informed about the latest sports trade or the biggest sports upset. i enjoy my brother and the bond that we share because it is unique and that makes it special. recently, i've noticed that he is growing up into a young man and i get a little sad. the only thing that makes this process easy is that the change will occur on the outside and not in the inside.

"as i sit here trying to think of something to say, my mind is completely blank. this kind of thing always happens when i am trying to write. i guess the only thing on my mind right now is whether or not i am going to make it at such a big school like ut. i have to walk a lot and the studying is sometimes hard. i am a music major a the time, but i really hate it. i think it is a worthless major. it's too much work for nothing. music majors don't make any money. i think that a big part of going to college is learning how to make money. i guess if i was really devoted to playing the piano money really wouldn't matter to me, but i couldn't see myself sitting on my ass playing the piano the rest of my life. i really want to do something exciting. another thing that is bothering me right now is the fact that i go to school 16 hours a week and i am only getting credit for 12. that's four hours i am not getting credit for. all of which are of course music classes. i only get 3 hours for a 5 hour musicianship class and i only get 1 hour for a 3 hour ensemble class. i really like it here, but i miss my friends back home. i think it is going to be weird seeing them again during thanksgiving and christmas. i want to know how their schools are and if they have been to any good parities or if they have made many friends. one thing about going to ut is that it is hard to make friends here because there are so many people. i  have, though, made friends with many people that i live with along with some people in my classes. i went to a pretty cool concert this weekend. i went with some of my friends that are still in high school. i miss hanging out with them. it was like old times again. i went with my old boyfriend and all of his friends. i was the only girl as always but that's what i'm used to. i guess i have to keep my attention on what i am doing here though. so that i can survive through college. i think my mom is going to be mad because i may have maxed out my phone card, but that is kinda off the subject. my mind wanders like that sometimes. tamesha is beating up her cd player. she is sitting next to my cursing at her portable cd player. now she is blowing the dust out of it because she thinks that it might work better if she does that. well my time is up, and just in time too because my mind just went blank again.

"     hi, my name is heather hughes. i am 18 years old. i am catholic, i   like to play the piano, i miss my family, i miss my friends. i do have   alot of friends that came to ut with me, but i didn't really hang out with   them much in high school because i had a boyfriend and seemed to live a   totally different life than they did. they were on the debate team, i was   on the dance team, i joined every organization there was in high school   because it gave me an explanation as to why my grades were not so great.  all my friends here are really smart, they all graduated in the top ten   percent of the class. my cell phone is ringing now. i really want to pick   it up, but i think it's just my cousin so i'll leave it alone. it kind of   gets on my nerves that she calls my cell phone all the time, instead of my   room number when i told her that when she calls it costs me alot, it's   long distance. i still have the same number from back home, so my mom can   call for free. i had a bad dream the other night about my mom. i dreamt   that she had done something really sweet for me,  and i didn't appreciate   it. all i could think about was being with my friends. when i came to   orientation this summer, i hated it! i called my mom every 20 minutes   telling her that i would rather go to texas tech or midland college, the   community college in my hometown. but now that i'm here, i really like it.  i don't miss her as much as i thought i would. i really miss my   exboyfriend. i think i disliked orientation so much because we had just   broken up. we had gone out all through high school, and he's at tech now.  that's where i really wanted to go. i got in, and into the business school   too, but i really wanted to be in the honors program. i guess i was a   little conceited and believed that i was smarter than the average student   at tech. anyway, i had applied really early and hadn't heard from them, i   waited and waited. i received my letter from ut but it didn't mean   anything to me, because i didn't know anything about this college, none of   my friends were going here, and kit wouldn't be here. but my parents gave   me a deadline and said i had to decide on a college by march 26 or   something. so, i decided to come here. i think mostly because i was upset   that tech wasnt' as eager to accept me into the honors college, and i also   thought, tons of couples go to different colleges, and if they can make   it, surely kit and i can. well, prom rolled around about 2 to 3 weeks   later, and kit made prom court. we were both amazed. because he made   court, he had to learn how to dance and eat properly, and wear a coat and   tails tux, which really didn't look that great on him since he was a bulky   football player. so the day of prom rolls around, and kit callls about 2   to say that the court got a limo. i thought   great, now we don't have to   worry about transportation!   but then he said there wouldn't be enough   room for the dates, just the court. so i asked him, am i suppossed to go   to prom alone? and he told me to have my parents drive me! i was so upset   becuase later on i found out the court had a choice to ride the limo or   not, and kit choose to ride with people he hardly knew than to take me. i   don't know if i'll ever be able to forget how awful he made me feel.  everytime i think of my prom, i'll always remember that. he also said   during prom , that i had been acting weird ever since i choose ut. that   made me even more upset, because he had never brought it up before, he had   always said, do what's best for you. i didn't know that he thought what   was best for me was him, and not a better education. i miss him so much. i   tried to get back with him this summer,and he said he wanted to too, but   everytime we'd almost get back together, he'd say no. that it would be too   hard to have a long distance relationship. i'm really disappointed in him,   this summer he went and got a tatoo, knowing that i dispise them, and   right before he left for tech he didn't tell me about it. a week later, i   ran into his parents at best buy and his mother told me. each time he does   something like this i vow this is the last time, i'm through with him, but   i keep going back, thinking about how good it used to be, and i fall in   love with his memory all over again. i wonder if he's dating anyone yet. i   d ",0
"right now i am a little worried that i am not doing this right because i don't really know what i am suppose to be writing about. well, i am excited because my best friend, courtney, is going to be in austin in about two hours. she started school in waxahachie about two weeks ago and i haven't seen her since then. we are going to the lake tomorrow and labor day and i can't wait. i love going to the lake with courtney because her grandma has two jet skis and she lets us use them as much as we want. i am excited about school starting. i have always planned on coming to ut, but i never thought the day would ever actually come. all my classes seem okay and all my teachers seem very nice and helpful. i think that i will do pretty well in all my classes this semester, but next semester i am going to have to take a nursing 310 class and the main part of the grade will be based on a major speech that i have to give. i hate giving speeches. i always think that i'll do okay, but when get up to give the speech i start to shake and sweat. i am getting better at it though. i believe that the more you do something like that the better you get at it. my freshman year in high school i was terrified of getting up in front of the class. i would be shaking so bad they could hardly understand what i was saying. it was also hard to play my flute solos in front of my band class. during my junior year i was getting better and had more confidence in myself and during my senior i played at region band and almost made district. i also performed skits and memorized a shakespeare sonnet and recited it in front of the class. i am glad that it has gotten easier for me, but it is still difficult for me to stand up and give speeches in front of people that i don't know very well. it's not as hard for me if it is in front of people that i know well or my family and friends. i just feel like people that i don't know are staring at me and judging me or something. now i just try to forget about that and try to focus on what i have to say. as a nurse i will have to deal with people a lot. i enjoy talking to people one on one, but i will probably eventually have to teach others or give speeches so i will have to overcome my fears and realize that it is really not that big of a deal. i hope that by the time i graduate college i will have no problem speaking in front of people and that i might even enjoy it.

(or at least one of them)  i miss her a lot. arlington and austin are far from each other and since she is only 16 it is hard for her to be allowed to come down here without her parents throwing a fit. they probably are worried about me. i sent them an email today because my aunt is a teacher at mansfield's summit, and she used to teach at grapevine high school, and i met a guy that had her as a teacher. he goes to south west texas. that is only 30 minutes away!  i am developing feelings for him. i went out with 11 boys on friday, and i was the only girl. ryan, the boy, was there too, and we hung out a lot of the time. he is really a great guy. i want to get to know him better. i saw him last night at our friend's house that introduced us, and he barely talked to me. i tryed to talk to him, and he was, i think, trying to talk to me, but this girl named cassidy kept interfering. she goes to osu and came down for the weekend to see all her   best friends  . whatever. she kept keeping him from talking to me. he told me to follow him around at one part. he made me laugh a lot. i really like it when guys make me laugh. another thing is that he makes me feel comfortable around him, like i have known him for a long time. that is another thing i look for in guys. being comfortable and laughing is a good combination of things to be. it makes me happy. my roommate is talking to her sister right now, and it makes me miss my sisters. they are both older than me and i miss them. i actually hung out with them all day today, so i don't know why i miss them. i love them a whole lot. it is amazing how when we grow up, we all become closer even though we are 3 and 6 years apart. i guess growing up makes everything between my family better!  blake felix is not cute and sarah is crushing on him and she made fun of me. jake anderton is such a liar and a big jerk. i don't know what made me think i would have fun with him. hello!!  differing personalities totally!!  i like musicals, for instance, and he doesn't know a thing about them. i want to be an actress one day, speaking of musicals, and i would love to do a show on broadway!  i want to go to la, though, first. that would be awesome to make a movie. courtney and her sister are even getting closer like my sisters are. woah!  that was totally off subject. i think it is because i am now writing this and listening to courtney talk. that is hard to do. kind of like listening to music and studying. it is hard. time up!

"my main thoughts right now consist of music. i am thinking of a new song that i wrote about my thoughts on the people that i have seen at ut. music i feel is the greatest thing in the world because i get to release all my emotions through a song. i think most people do not understand music or in that same since the love for sound and melody. these reasons have helped me to conclude why people like bad music like boy bands. surely anybody with any amount of intelligence could see that these bands or groups, have no talent except that they can sing other peoples songs. i don't believe any of them write their own songs, so i can't see why people would think they are talented. this brings me to something else i do not like about people, they are generally fake. what i mean by this is that they do everything to impress others and not them selves. for example, people try to fit in with a crowd by wearing certain types of clothes and name brands of everything. this things i do not do and hopefully never will. i feel that people really do not know what they want or even how to get to where they do know. i thought by coming to ut that i would see less of this type of attitude from people but i now know that this is not the case and people are like that everywhere go in life. from this point i would like to say that ut is great(except for parking)and that i do like more people here then i did in high school. i am not sure what i want to do with the education i am receiving from this school but i hope that very soon i will recognize my calling in life.

"i am bored, i don't know what to write. i think that i am going to enjoy college. i miss my friends and family from back home, but i am starting to mak new friends here. i will probably go home to visit this weekend for the labor-day holiday. if i do go, i want to make sure that i will have plety of time to rest up, because last time that i went i didn't really get mush time to sleep, so i was pretty tired on my way back. i have been tired all week long now. i went to bed after midnight last night and then i had to get up this morning at five so that i could go do the pt test for the airforc rotc. we didn't even do anything except count how many reps the upperclassman did. i wish that we could have worked out too. i really hate it while i am doing it, but afterwards i feel pretty good. tuesday, when i got done with my pt test, i started throwing up on the field. i was pretty tired from the push-ups and the sit-ups already and didn't quite catch my breath yet when i had to start the two mile run. my time for the run went up a minute. i will try to get that back down. i want to be able to max out the push ups and the sit ups by the end of the semester. i want to get as fast at the run as well, becase if you max the run, it is worth twice as much as maxing the pushups or situps. but i care more about those than the run. i need to make up an excercise schedule for the rotc. i don't really know when i want to do everything. i will probably just do pushups and situps in the mornings before class. since i have to wake up at five on tuesdays and thursdays, i usually wake up pretty early the other days as well. i will just do those excercises and then do my homework. in the evenings, i will go downstairs to the little gym that is here in my dorms to work out. that should be plenty of excercise. i will probably not be able to do it all of the time though. i wanted to start doing the pushups and situps in the mornings this week, but i barely have enough sleep to wake up and go to class much less to work out. i think that i will like it in the air force. it doesn't look like i had thought that it would be. they were saying that they weren't allowed to yell at people in their faces like they always have on tv. it looks a little more respectable that the army. i hope that i will like it. on tuesday, two cadets each recieved a 2000 dollar scholorship. i want to find out what they had to do to get them. someone said that to get it you have to have a 4. 0 gpa. i'll bet that there is more to it than that. but i want to try to get a 4. 0 anyways. if i have to get a loan, it will look better. it will also make me more elligible for scholorships. i am going to need the money. next year,   i think that i will get and apartment or an efficiency to live in. i think that i would like that more than living in a dorm. it is too noisy here. my roomates are nice, but they like to stay up late, and i always have to get up early, so it irritates me a little bit. i know that they aren't trying to be loud, but when i am dead tired, and they have a bunch of friends over, i just want to scream. but next year i will have my own place by myself. that will be nice. the only problem will be that i will have to cook for myself. i don't really know how to make anything except for scrambled eggs, macaroni and cheese, and breakfast cereal. that probably won't be very nourishing. i will probably need to get a roomate that likes to cook or something. maybe melinda and i could move in together and she could cook the food and do the dishes while i go to school. she could also babysit in the apartment to make some extra money. but i don't think that there will be enough money for us to do that. i would really like to help her out, but i don't have enough money, and in the past, every time that i helped her, it just ended up costing my a lot of money, and then after a week or two, she would be back in the same situation, needing my help again. it was very irritating, also. still, she is a very good friend that i know will always care for me. she is very nice. i just don't think that she is very good handling money. but not everyone is good at that. she is very good with kids, and i'm not very good with them at all myself. i never know what to say to them. i start off talking about cartoons and stuff like that, but after a few minutes, i run out of stuff to say. my cousin dillian liked me pretty much though. my mother was telling me about how he was so excited that i always made breakfast for him in the mornings when he was over. but i was pretty bored when i was watching him. i couldn't always understand what it was that he was saying, and for the last day,all that he wanted to do was make ice cream out of play-dough and for me to pretend to eat it. it wasn't too bad the first time, but he did it for about a half hour.

"i think about my mother, my ex-boyfriend in houston(of whom i'm still in love with) and just things that are going on in my life right now. all of the stressed of being on my own and all this is just really overwhelming. and for some reason during all of this i listen to the most depressing tori amos or sarah mclachlan song. after a good cry i always feel better, i think it's healthy to cry though. i think it's good to deal with things rather than to create something to do and keep yourself busy. dealing with things, for me, is the best way to get over them. but sometimes i tend to obsess over things rather than just simply dealing with them straight out. i seem to have reverted back to my pre-teen years when i would cry myself to sleep because my mother was no longer with me. my parents got divorced at that time, about when i was 11 years old or so. i remember every night listening to sad music and just crying because i missed her. she and i have one of the best relationships i've ever seen between parent and child. she is my friend not just my mother. but i don't cross boundaries, i respect them wholly and recognize them way in advance. i think some people take advantage of when they are friends with their parental unit, use it to their advantage, i just respect it and cherish it with all my heart. i quote sarah mclachlan, """"and i have the sense, to recognize, that i don't know how to let you go. """"  i think that line has described my relationship with my boyfriend for the past year. we've broken up twice but we always seem to end up in each other's lives at some point or another. i guess it's a good thing, he's a wonderful person and a great person for me. but i just don't know if i can do this (be in love with him have a relationship, what have you) with him being in houston and me here in austin. i don't know if i want him calling me telling me how much he misses me, and telling me he loves me when he's two hours away. i guess it's not that much of a distance compared to other people's long distance relationships, but i think it takes a certain type of person to be in one of those. i certainly know they're not for me. and from his past experiences with them, all bad, i know he's not too keen on the idea either. i miss him terribly, touching him, smelling him, his humor, his voice, everything. e-mail and phone conversations don't suffice. i just got a new laptop and i wrote my friend this huge letter with like six big paragraphs and i hit this button on accident and it deleted the whole thing. ugh!  i hate this thing, but i really don't i like having it to take to the library. i just need to learn how to do everything and what not to do. i'm not into reading these huge dictionary size manuals on things. they just don't interest me that much. i'm much more of a trial and error person. except when it comes to math basically because i don't want to sit there for hours trying to figure something out. i want a formula there for in my face. we're doing these circuit things in that class that is all trial and error right now. it's a total bitch. i made three really cool friends in that class. one of my friends tim i saw at a club the other weekend and remember him from the hallway in which we were both lost together. i wish he were cuter, he's a really nice guy. and i made these two other friends tracie(same name as my best friend) and stephanie. they're both really cute, and tracie seems like she'd be a lot of fun to go out and party with. she was telling me about her cousin's friend who's gay and just moved to new york to go into fashion. imagine that. but i would love to go to new york. especially after seeing that movie a perfect murder , i mean i know not everyone there has a huge penthouse on central park but i would love to just go visit it. i love the whole image of it, it's just very chic for some reason. i would live there if i could get a very high paying position somewhere, but that's the only way i would. it's just too crowded otherwise.

"well, i am sitting in the library right now, you know the one across from  jester center. i am hard at work trying to think of things and writing  them down as i go along. oh, i just heard someone moving in  his seat making  a creaking noise. there he goes again. why can't he this guy sit still. boy am i sleepy, my neck has a cramp and there goes that guy again moving in  his in his seat. oh, the fountain (i had to look up for this one) is making  noise. okay. it stopped now. boy am i tired. i wish i was sleeping right now. i can hear people walking in the distance and someone flipping through pages  in a book. i wonder what he is looking for. it is probably something for his  ultra tough class. man, i am tired. excuse me but i have to stop writing for  a second. boy i really can not see anything without my glasses. my eyesight  must be really bad. go figure, i have been wearing glasses since the 7th grade. i liked them at first and thought they were cool but i despise wearing glasses. it hurts my ears and gives me a headache  sometimes. ah, just needed to pull  the chair in a little. man, i wish someone was here to massage my neck and  shoulder, preferably a girl. this just can not get any worse, now i am  beginning to feel pain in my forearm from writing so much. i think i am really  out of shape for my forearm to be hurting so much. wow, this is truly horrific,  everything around me is a blur. man, if someone killed every one in this room  and i saw him. i would probably not be able to identify him or even describe  him to the police. boy, my sight is so bad. good, i only have about eight more  minutes of writing. i wish i can go to sleep right now, but no, i have to  finish this writing assignment. man, does this mean i would have to type this  on the computer. great, well i will be getting out of here real soon. oh, i can  see much better now. what is with the neck cramp. things could not get any  worse for me. here i am sitting here and having to write for at least twenty  minutes on the stream of my conscience. my eyes are drooping and heavy, my  chest is in pain from the way i am sitting, and my right arm is so tired. please stop! dude, i have about three more minutes. time sure flies by real  fast. yeah right! cool, that guy has an outline of a roadrunner on the back of  his shirt. man, well is he not a little too noisy. i mean we are in the library,  man, and people are trying to do a writing assignment for psychology here, man. dude, i just heard the door opened and shut. alright, i can finally stop now. hope you like it. that was twenty minutes of my life down the tube. thanks a  lot. just kidding. ha! ha!

"right now, as i am writing this paper, i am thinking that i have a lot reading to do this coming up weekend for the following week's classes. i have a pounding headache, which i believe i got while walking to and from my spanish class because i forgot my sunglasses in my dorm room. otherwise, i am looking forward to this weekend. tonight my boyfriend and i are probably going to sixth street for a little while and tomorrow we are going to the texas vs. louisiana football game, the first game of the season. i'm really excited about the football game, but i hope it's not too hot (although i'm sure it will be). my boyfriend's parents are also coming in for the game and they are taking us out to eat for dinner. i'll be glad to have a break from the repetitive dorm cafeteria food. on sunday, i'm meeting my friends who goes to southwest and we are going to schlitterbahn water park. i'm having a hard time writing this because my head really hurts. i took two aleves, but i suppose they have not kicked in yet. while i do my homework i always have to have some kind of noise, whether it be music, television, or a fan, to be able to concentrate on what i am doing. when it is completely silent my mind seems to wander from what i am writing or reading and i end up thinking about something completely different, then looking back at the paragraph i just read and asking myself """"what did i just read?"""" i hate when i do that because i feel like i just wasted 10 minutes of my time and i don't even know what i was doing while wasting. i don't know. that probably didn't make much sense at all. at the moment, my fan is on, my radio is playing, and my roommate is talking to her mom on the telephone, so there is plenty, almost too much, noise going on around me. i really am enjoying this assignment because it just puts everything that you think about for 20 minutes onto a piece of paper. when i look at it i think that i must be a slow typist because i thought i think about a lot more things in 20 minutes than this. it has now been 20 minutes so i am ending my paper and trying to think of a good way to end it but it is not coming to me at the moment.

"     stream of thought. this is interesting because it seems like i've done this many times on my own. keeping a journal of things i'm feeling or things that have been on my mind, but i can never quite finish a thought before another one pops into my mind. i've been at the chi o house for almost 2 hours today, but wait- instead of studying at the chi o house i spent those 2 hours trying to save an apartment for myself and 3 friends next year. that didn't work because you can't forget to speak to your father when it comes to issues of money (whether it's his money or your own). i'm a little frustrated because i haven't been able to get my computer hooked up to the ethernet service at hardin house yet. ok, very frustrated. i'm even using my roommate's computer at the moment. not that that is a bad thing, but hey, maybe i want to use my own computer!  oh well- she's never here anyway. i kind of like it bc she has all of her classes in the morning and mine are pretty much spread out through the entire day, so we don't see each other that much. it keeps us from getting sick of each other, and we still find the other person amusing when we do spend time together. on the other hand, my best friend from high school- i'm about to scream!  i was so hoping that when i came to ut, a school of collosal size, that it might be possible for me to get away from westlake; branch out; make some new friends; have some new experiences. while all this is taking place, i still seem to have this tie to my high school- her name is robin. she hadn't always planned on coming to ut. as a matter of fact, she wanted to go to baylor with our friend blair (robin is my closest friend, but i kind of wish she had gone to baylor) but one day she just made up her mind and here we are. still   summer and robin   or   robin and summer  . . why can't i just be my own person???  i enjoy having time to myself. don't get me wrong, i am a very outgoing person- i love to meet new people- i even want to dual major in public relations (and photography), but sometimes it's nice to just not have to talk to anyone. to just be alone. this thing with robin has gotten out of hand!  now that she's seen how much fun i had going through rush she wants to rush next year. now that she knows i'm going to do young life leadership she wants to do yl leadership. i drive her to church every morning and then to her house afterwards (it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay out of the way. but she's my friend, so i do it). i'm signing up to do texas angels next year, so she's going to sign up to be an angel. and the list goes on. i can understand that yeah she may actually be interested in these things- and i'm so glad she's wanting to be involved in things like young life and lake hills church (which meets at our high school by the way) but i need some air. it's even gotten to the point where i actually feel guilty if i hang out with'make new friends!  that's not right!!!  the thing is i know i need to just talk to her and let her know what i'm thinking (maybe not to the full extent) but she has a right to know how spending so much time together is hurting our friendship more than helping it. i just hate to hurt her feelings. it'll work out. i can't believe i'm writing all these thoughts down for other people to see. i'm assuming other people will read this because it's an assignment, but hey. stream of consciousness eh? :)  i've recently been reading this book called   when god writes your love story   and i wish i could spend more time reading it to get it finished. it's really interesting, although often cheezy, but it talks about god being the center of your life and the center of your relationship with members of the opposite sex. the thing that hits me most strongly is when it talks about how instead of pursuing relationships, we should give this area to god and let him pick out our partner for us. i've known that god has someone special picked out for me, but i never thought of actually backing off and letting god bring him to me. i know he will, but it's hard to not be looking for that someone. yeah. . still a little rusty on the subject - that's why i should actually finish the book! :)  and that's another thing- i have not been keeping up with my quiet times recently!  not just recently. it's been quite some time. i want to but there's just not that constant desire you know?  it's something that i need to be praying about. there are lots of things i need to be praying about, such as continued enthusiasm for my studies at ut. i am so excited about all of my classes!  they are all soooo amazingly interesting to me, and i hope i just don't get burnt out on any of them. the only class i'm having a big problem with is my biology class. i'm so interested in the material, but my professor just sucks. she's nice, and i can tell she's interested in and excited about the information, but she just doesn't know how to present it in a way that others might find it interesting as well. i've never fallen asleep in a class until this one!  and yeah. . i haven't made it to that 8am biology discussion lab on fridays. it's not like i go out and party (and i don't ever have hangovers then bc i just plain don't drink at all) but i'm such a night person!  actually i dont' know what the deal is. ever since middle school i haven't gone to bed before midnight and now that's more like 2am.  but no matter what time i go to sleep early or late, i cannot for the life o fme wake up the next morning. it's an impossibility. time is almost up i wish there was more time to write though. oh well.

"i notice that my mind always wonders off to the things in my life that i wish were better. i tend to think about the differences between what i should be doing in my life right now, and what i am doing. i also find that one person in particular continues to pop into my head, a girl no less, one that i knew about a year ago, only for a brief period of time, but i miss her every day. i also have thoughts of longing to be back home, with my mom and my dogs. i miss high school. i built up a large list of friends over a span of twelve years, and now all of a sudden i'm starting from scratch again. like kindergarten in a way. i also feel the pressure of my mouting homework that continues to pile up, atop of which sits two gigantic architecture projects, both of which are do in a shorter amount of time then i am capable of finishing them in. life is getting harder. being a kid was so easy. i want to be a rock star. the path was set, my band was doing great, writing songs, about to cut our first albm, when college ripped us apart. nothing makes sense anymore. take me home.

" today is thursday, september 12th. yesterday was 9'11. i wasn't too scared about it cause i knew that nothing would happen. it was just kind of sad, i guess. everytime i turned on the t. v. there was something about it. the sad stories, the encouraging ones about the heroes. by the end of the day, i was just kind of fed up with it. there was this one part that certaintly got my attention. on mtv, they were having this 30 seconds thing, where some people talked about something dealing with 9'11. there was this one guy who had a long beard, and looked liked an afghan, and he said that one day this guy just punched him out of no where, just because he looked like that. i think that is just so extremely stupid, he wasn't even an muslim, he was a shikh or something. i mean you cannot really blame the few that did that to the entire muslim society. i mean there are 1 billion muslims, they can't all be terrorists. but i don't really blame them, cause i mean even if i was in their places, i would kind of react the same way. although, i would try not to. but, now things are changing. not many people hate you just because one is a muslim. oh well, enough about this.   i saw this cute chick on 9'11. she was in the biology class. she was just sooo  cute. i should have talked to her, but before i knew it she was gone. hopefully, i will see her next time.          today was the draw for the texas-ou game. i didn't get the tickets, my draw number was on the 80000s, and the tickets were sold out at 79450. this kind of . . i mean only 450 people got to get tickets, i mean, why they couldnt more tickets for the students. i was really disappointed. but i am still a freshmen so maybe next coming years.          i am going home this weekend, first time after school started. i am really looking forward to it. just need a few days away from ut. its seems like i have been here more than 3 weeks. it should be fun.        i also have test coming up starting next week. hopefully i will do good. i really need to make as many as as i can. i have to transfer to the school of business, which is the hardest to get into. hopefully, i will get in.          after i get done with this, i have to finish my calculus homework. its due tomm at 3 in the morning. what kind of time is that. last week i didnt turn it in because i thought, it was 3 in the afternoon. i didnt look if it was p. m. or a. m. i was done with it too. i was sooooooo mad. i guess i learned my lesson though. but still, 3 in the morning, whats up with the time.          i had a quiz in economics today, it was soo hard compared to the one last week. last week's quiz was a piece of cake. it was sooo easy. i hate when teacher'sorry professors do this. they make the first test'quiz easy and the second or the final exam are like really hard. be consistent, you know.         i have 3 minutes left, ummm,  this class is kind of fun. i like dr. penebaker, if i spelled that right, his examples and stuff are soo funny. but my economics professor is just as cool, dr. hamermesh. both of the class are fun. cal and chemistry are alright, not as much fun.        it is soo quiet in this lab, you could hear the roar of the computers. ut is weird, sometimes is soo quiet, while other soo crowded and loud. i guess i am getting used to it though. well my time is up. it was fun writing this. its kind of girly though, like a journal.

"     i was so excited about coming to ut and i still am but alot of things just over whelm me. for example, people in austin are not a friendly as college students at other schools. basically im talking about the girls its all about what frat your in and bullshit like that. i am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example psychology i am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and i am always worried that im not taking the right notes. what it really comes down to is that im always worried about grades and wether my parents are gunna accept my grades. i always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i won't let my self be that bad of a student. i worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say f*** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up. i think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student. i nother thing that bothers me are bad room mates like my room mate now he has a 4. 0 in buisness honors and basically i thinks that he is right on everything. that really pisses me off because he has no common since and living with him has not been the best thing because i can already tell that his parents have done everything for him because he never cleans up after himself and he is always trying to blaim me for plates and food that gets left out and it is always him. i know that sounds stupid but i don't forget to put food back in the frig because i love to eat so food is important to me and i would not for get it. one thing that i don't like about living in austin is that it is so expensive to live here. every place on campus is between 700 and 900 dollars a month not including the electric bill, gas bill or telephone bill. i really wish the weather would get better it is so hot right now that walking to class has been killing me, i hate to sweat and i swear thati walk into class looking like i just got out of the pool. one more thing that is really bothering me is my ex-girl friend like we were only together for all of july and august and i broke up with her because she goes to tcu and i got to ut and i would not work out. but i always find myself wanting to call her and she always calls me but everytime we end up getting in a fight and and we never ever faught when we were together. i wish life was easier because if she went to school here i would not ever have a problem except for guys trying to talk to her. that is one of my biggest flaw with her is that she is so hot and guys are always trying to hit on her right in front of me and she always tells them that she has a boyfriend but i always wonder if she says that when im not around i really worried about that this summer. and now she calls asking about girls and weather i was dating someone and i really think that she is one of the perfect girls that changes in different scenes. for example, in dallas she is the best beautiful and kind and the best personality but everytime i went with her to tcu i felt like i was with a different person and that really bothers me because i hate fake people. my goal is to find a girl that never lies and i will be happy for the rest of my life with that girl. i can't wait for that day that i get a great job and find the women of my dreams.

"it's sunday and i need to go to church since i didn't go this morning because i woke up at 11:15 and church is at 11:30. so i already took a shower and i'm dressed to go at 8:00 p. m. right now it's 7:25 and i wish it was about 4 because it seems like the day has just went by and i haven't done very much. that's alright though because i'm listening to my favorite rap music. trick daddy dollars, ja rule, dmx, ice cube, hot boys, juvenile, black & dangerous, k-roc, too short, twista, and jt money they seem to make me feel better. even if i'm feeling down in the dumps a few rap songs seem to bring me back to reality and happiness. earlier my girlfriend called and we had a serious fight because she gave my roommate a little attitude yesterday when she called. she got mad because i was not here and my roommate didn't know my cell number or my friend's which is where i was at. so i had to lay down the law and tell her not to take out her anger on my roommate. i was mad also because i gave her my cell number the day before but she didn't write it down. so we argued for a while about that then she told me something that her and her friend did that i didn't approve of. so i was instantly angered because i have a short temper to begin with. it was a big deal really but i don't let anything go by even the smallest fuckups. so we started to have any even greater argument than the first one and didn't end on a good note. she decided that she didn't want to talk to me if we were going to argue. i acted like i didn't care so we just ended it there. this worries me because i hate to end it like that but i'm so hardheaded that i won't let anyone know that they're really hurting me. it also hard because i'm here and she's 355 miles away and i can't see her the way i use to. i guess i'm going to have to get use to this and college is a lot different from what i'm use to. the girls wooo some of them are pretty fine and all the people i've never seen so many people in one place at one time. being from a small town this is a totally different atmosphere that i'm not used to. hopefully i'll find my place here make the best of it and things will turn out great. i don't want to let college change me in the wrong ways. whatever happens i'll just try to do my best and do the best i can as things come along.

"there are some very strange things on tv. i don't watch tv all that often, but when i do it gets stranger and stranger. i love to eat. i eat constantly. sometimes i wonder what it really is driving me to eat all of the time. crunch and munch is the snack of choice for me at the moment. buttery toffee popcorn with peanuts, it is funny to think why it is so good. but it is intriguing. why do people change? i often wonder why she did it to me, what did i do to deserve it? i thought she was my friend, but i guess i was wrong. without trust, friendship means nothing. i often think of this as i look at my relationships with other people, do i really trust them? i wonder why i sit and harass myself with the torture of scrutinizing every aspect of my life. why do i? i know there is nothing wrong with me, yet i still sit here and ask myself what i could do differently. i need to accept that people do change, including myself. i believe i am addicted to instant messaging. it is a remarkable invention. to be able to """"talk"""" instantaneously with my friends all over the country is just unbelievable. i can carrying on a conversation with as many people as i can handle at one time, but usually i just stick to two or three or it becomes too much to handle. i don't even know if this is making any sense, but i don't really care. the thing with instant messaging is that i have an obsession with wondering who is on or who is getting off, i have to check every time i hear the sound of the door opening and closing, even if i have no intention of actually talking to anyone. why do i play mind games all of the time? i really do. i sit here and plot ways to make him want me or make him think i am mad or happy or whatever. i seriously need to quit eating this crap. it may taste good, but i know it can't be good for me. this is ridiculous, i really do need to stop eating.

"it's me. tying along, this is somewhat interesting, i''ll probaboly copy it onto my computer after i am done, after all, i am kind of interested in trackin gmy thoughts. when i talked with allison the other day, it helped to have i'm on instead of being on the phone. it allowed me to communicate and review what we had said to eachother. i really really really hope that we don't end up playing eachother this weekend, as i don't want to play her. i know i won't paly  ehr because myu lov efor her is true. and she won't paly me either, but exactly what will transpire i'm not too sure. how far is too far for the realtionsip we're in reight now? what is the relationship we're in right now? i trhink i want intimacy, but i'm not too sure. is it abuse of eachother if we don't miss eachother tremendously? io miss her tons, but i can now ahve fun without her. i do need her, but it's less than it used to be. when she dumped me, it really hurt. i neve said that i dumped her, but i understand why she thought that. life's a dance - at least it's no longer a bitch. i wonder if i couldn't go to sleep last night because i was so excited about seeing her this weekend, or because i had just finished my exercises. how long does it take the body to calm down after exercising. i didn't sleep well, but i don't think it was due to her. i'm just stuck on what kind of intimacy should be shared this weekend. i do love her. i'm pretty convinced of that. after all, she is the most beautiful woman in the world to me. i know that my feelings for her have a lot to do with that. she has a great smile. i hope that she jumps on me when i show up. it would make me feel very special. io'll definitely be excited to se her. iknow she is looking forward to seeing me too. i kind of wonder whether it is better for me to be leaving on sunday or saturday. i don't really have much choice in the matter, but i could take a bus. i want her to come to ut. at ut the logistics would flow much smoother. i'm more than willing to dedicate my whole weekend to her. this would mean i would miss her more during the week, but it would be worth it. i have friends here, which really really helps. for example, last night i went up and worked on my spreadsheet and webpage while watching a movie with them. of course, the movie was an 80s movie, and it just reminded me of her, but it was still fun. i do love her. i love love lovee love love love love love her. love can be messy. it's okay for love to be disastorous - so long as you don't lose sight of the person you love. a lot of times i feel like i'm the only one that cares about us as a relationship. when i did that thing at dave and busters she was ready to break up. i didn't feel as if it was cause. i understand why she was mad, but i also kind of expected her to understand that i was frustrated. she says she loves me, but does she? she does things that indicate both ways. i don't think that i do things that indicate that i don't love her, but maybe i do. i wish she would tell me when i do'say things that hurt her. she really hurt me, when she said that it was better to be broken up right now. i want her to have fun. i used to be somewhat egotistical about it, but right now i just want us to fully enjoy eachothers company and miss each other enough so that it's not abuse of the relationship. maybe nothing will happen this weekend. i hope that she spends time with me after the game. i expect her to spend time saturday morning studying, which is fine. i just know that i'm not going to have anything to do. i will bring my computer, but i will only be able to work on stuff that has no deadline. if it has a deadline, then it will have to be done sunday night if it's not done over the weekend. that would stink. i come back, and i won't be able to see any of my friends because i have homework to do. i really do miss allison. i'll probably do my psy reading this week. the republic is read enough for a while, but do i want to start getting ahead? probably should. the problem with lowering our love relationship to a friendship thing is that then we will never see if our love is true. i don't want to make the worst mistake of my life, when i'm not sure of it. allison is beautiful. sure, she has some qualms about being outside in the heat, but otherwise she's ideal. except, that i do wonder sometimes if she is in love with me. we should go do some outside type stuff. she has a set prenotion that she doesn't want to go camping, when in reality it could be quite fun. my parents don't do outside stuff together. allison has swallowed the heat thing before - that says how much she loves me. it couldn't have been cold the second time at miller outdoor theater. we've kissed in the heat before. the only thing is that a lot of my romantic ideas were for outside - the waterfall (not original), galveston. romantic by its very nature means of nature - she wants someone to possibly sweep her off her feet, but i don't know if that's possible. i do love her. well, it's actually time that this 20 minutes has past. it has passed quicker than i expected it too.

"of course maybe today is a good day because i am feeling such a flood of emotions at the moment. and this will probably be a good release, you know? i don't know i have been kind of down lately. maybe it is this new university environment. i'm having difficulty adjusting i guess. it's all kind of overwhelming. too many things at once. i really wanted to call mauricio and talk about what happened in mexico. stuff that shouldn't have happened between us, but it did nonetheless and it really shouldn't have but i am also kind of glad in a way that it did. but instead of calling him like i wanted too i called randy. i hadn't talked to him for three weeks i guess. i want to talk to him about what happened in mexico also, but i can't. i just can't. it would just cause more unneeded problems i am afraid. so i called him, he was a bad mood as usual lately. i had already been feeling poorly lately and talking to him while he was in that mood wasn't such a good idea it's just that he is one of my best friends and i want to know what is going on in his life. i realize he is having a hard time right now, but he i don't know. i just wish he was more excited to talk to me or something. instead he just upsets me more, and that on top of everything else just makes me cry. crying is a good release though. but i didn't want to. so being like that i wanted to call mauricio even more and sort out some things with him so that would be one less overwhelming thing to deal with right now, but i agree with andrea and think i should wait for him to call me. but i don't know if i am going to be able to. but i will try. i called my step-mom instead. she immediately knew something was wrong with me. i really miss my mom. venezuela, my friends, the life i had there. it was so great looking back on it. but i don't want to think that the best years of my life have already passed, i want to think that future holds so much, that i have so much to look forward to. i believe i do i just need to get past this emotional slump i have been in. but it is kind of difficult. i really miss mauricio. i wish he were here in austin. i feel like right now he is the one i should talk to about everything. i wish i knew how he felt, i just wish he would call me. christi, thinks i should go and buy a new telephone cable among doing other things. she thinks that if i had regular internet access i would be a whole lot happier. it's not that i not happy. i don't want to be a depressed person, i want to be a happy responsible in-control person. not a sad depressed one that no one want s to be around. i don't think i am usually. i just am in a bad situation lately i guess. i am letting too many things get to me and drag me down. i need to focus on what is important and do one thing at a time. and not get so overwhelmed. i think going home next weekend will be a good break for me as well. i didn't think that i would miss it so much, but i do. a lot actually. i just want to feel my normal comfort level. to know what is going on, although i do not want to be in high school. i just want to be able to i don't know be normal. i thought i would be here, but i am not. i don't know how people do it. how they cope. i think i am lot weaker than i thought. i don't mean that. i don't know what i think. i think that i am almost done with this assignment. it has almost been twenty  minutes. i can't believe it. i thought it would take forever. but i guess it really didn't. hopefully i will talk to mauricio soon. i now i have been focused on him a lot. but it's hard not to be. of course i might not see him for a long time, but. let's not think about that right now.

"i am hungry. i haven't eaten since last night. i have a chemistry test on thursday and i do not understand some of the stuff. i hope nobody comes to my home on wednesday night. usually people are always at my home and i don't get any studies done. they stay until 2 or 3 at night and then it is too late to study. why don't i study in my room? probably because i don't want to study when people are outside partying. why don't you go to the library? i don't want to go to the library. after 5, i don't want to have anything to do with school. i don't want to think it even exists. library reminds of school. on wednesday, i get off at 5. good i have until 9 to study until people come over. 4 hours is more than enough to study for a stupid test that is probably easy as hell. i am just worrying over nothing. i actually like it when people come over; it is not boring then. just do your studies early and then party later. i had heard there were fine women in this university but i was fooled. i haven't seen any girl that is eye popping fine. all the girls on campus have the same old stuff. legs and other stuff that i do not want to mention here. i am sick of the same old stuff, why can't there be a girl that has a pretty face with all that other stuff. like a perfect package. well whatever it is damn hot outside. i have to go to my classes in this heat and then study my brains out. then go to work and then return home again in this damn heat and still not see a fine girl. then take the bus home and then study again. then i hang out with my friends. which makes doing all this worth it. and i would just like to comment that the damn west campus bus takes at least a half an hour to get to the bus station and sometimes it is full and you have to wait another half hour for another bus. they need to freaking spend a little money to buy more busses, cheap skates. i have do go through all this crap and then i can't even get a decent ride home.

"boy bands  they suck big time. i'm listening to the radio right now and one of the 50 is on. i do not see the huge interest in them. they all seem fake since new kids on the block. they were the original hotties! i can't tell if it's my allergies or if i'm getting sick, but my nose has been running ever since this past weekend. i got to go see my niece and nephew this weekend. i really enjoyed that. for once i got to go out of town on labor day. my parents always said next year, or later this year. i'm amazed we got out of texas this year. we were supposed to go to italy this summer, but that fell through. then we were supposed to go to new york, and that didn't feel right. then we all finally decided on orlando. my brother was going to bring his girlfriend and we were all going to have a great weekend break from the routine. that didn't work either. we ended up cutting that one to. finally we decided that it was our turn to go to california to see my nieces and nephews. it was fun, but they sure are weird. i have an older half brother, an older half sister, and an older halfhalf sister. we really aren't related, but we are still pretty close. we have a lot of fun together. i don't talk to my half sister anymore. she's a bit. sorry. she's mean and selfish. she told me that i stole her dad from her. she has some serious problems. she has to be the center of attention, and she's always trying to be better than everyone else. if something good is happening between two people she has to stir things up. she's a complete brat. she's too used to getting everything her way. i hope my roommate can't see up my shorts. i don't know if this is something that happens with time, but i really don't like underwear anymore. i don't understand how some people can wear the granny kind of underwear. sorry if i am offending you. but hey, this is my stream of consciousness. i'm really looking forward to this class. my mom had a lot of fun teaching it. i've always wanted to be like her in some way or another. i've always looked up to her. somehow she is always right. there are the few occasions, but for the most part she's always right. sometimes it makes me sick. i'm running out of things to talk about. hmmm. i miss my friends from wimberley. i'm a freshman. so many of my friends went to different schools or are still in high school. i was the oldest in my group of friends. my parents keep telling me how some of the girls are looking up to me, and want to be like me when they get to college. i love to hear that kind of stuff. it really keeps me in check. yeah! one of the songs i always sing with a girl i hung out with all summer is on. it's weird, but it seems like juniors and freshmen always hook up. i don't mean like going out, but also in just hanging out. it seems like there's always two years in between close friends. i have a friend who just turned 16 and she is so pumped. i feel really bad, because her mom and step dad are getting divorced right now. she just moved from her last home. i'm pissed at her step dad. he said that he wanted a divorce because he felt he wasn't providing enough for his child, which is crap!. he gave her everything she ever asked for, plus some. so now he has put my friend, her mom, and her brother out in the cold. he's a jerk. i'm not going to go any more into this subject. i'd get too heated. this time has really passed pretty fast. i'm surprised! i don't get why people drink alcohol. i just don't get it. i have plenty of fun sober. sometimes more fun than my friends have, and they have hang overs the next day. it makes no sense to me. being sober's the way for me! well, this was fun. i'll chat with you later!

"what does the drug ecstasy do to the brain? i have been very curious about this for some time now. maybe you could tell us what studies have concluded about this drug. the reason why i am so curious is because many of my friends have recently discovered and become enchanted with it. in fact, in about the middle of the second semester of my senior year in high school, it became almost like an ecstasy epidemic! several of my friends have done it up to 11 or 12 times already! i haven't tried it since i refuse to do drugs but i'm really interested to find out what its long term effects are and why it produces the reaction that it does. apparently, when on ecstasy, it feels as if nothing can go wrong and everything is perfect. music is everything and once listening, someone who is rolling (the term used to define the feeling one gets after taking x) can't pull away. also, they say they feel as if they have """"lungs of steel"""" in that they are constantly smoking cigarettes and feel as if they can't stop. oh, and the mouth chewing. why does that happen? their mouths jitter while they're rolling and after the drug wears off, their mouths hurt or feel sore. that's why you can tell when someone is rolling at a party. well, first of all they're sweating profusely and also they're chewing lots and lots of gum! its crazy actually. i went to a rave with my friends last saturday. it was at austin music hall. at least 70% of the people attending the rave was rolling on x. well, essentially, that's what rave's are for. its a closed space with djs who spin techno and trance music for a huge group of people, the majority of whom is xing like crazy! anyway, my friends had a blast there. of course they were rolling. i had fun too, but not nearly as much i imagine! in fact, it was 3:30 in the morning, we had been dancing for at least 4 hours straight, and one of my friends refused to leave because he was rolling so hard and not remotely tired. doesn't this sound crazy? what does the drug do to people? have any severe, longlasting consequences been discovered for sure. i've been told several theories, some of which include the brain bleeding, there being permanent damage on the spine, memory loss, and brain cells being killed. sounds like some dangerous stuff these people are playing around with. if it weren't an illegal drug, i'd definitely try it (provided it didn't totally screw me up in the future!) considering how wonderful everyone tells me it is. and not just word of mouth. i've seen people on it countless times. they look as if they could die happy right then and there! i don't know if you're planning on discussing anything like this in class but i'm really interested in finding out more about x. just out of curiosity! well, i think i'd like to talk about something remotely related. one of the guys whom i'm talking about, in fact, he's in this class with me, is named j. i went to high school with him but we were never friends. we hung out at the same parties with the same group of people generally, but we barely even talked to each other. well he and his friend are living at towers together and since we're all down here together we've been hanging out a lot. a whole lot, in fact. and i wasn't really planning on anything happening between us but the night of the rave, a lot of people stayed the night at their place, including me, and we kind of """"hooked up. """" now, ever since then, we've kind of been messing around well, nothing much. the thing is, we haven't mentioned it to each other at all. we keep doing it but don't discuss it. so i'm not sure what the deal is. i think i like him. well, actually, yes i do like him. the problem is. does he like me? i can't tell either way. i mean, he's a guy so just the fact that he keeps fooling around with me doesn't mean much. he could hate my guts for all i know and still be doing what he's doing just to get some! that would really suck. and i don't want to ask him because, well for one, i wouldn't know what to say. and for two, i'm scared of the answer. that would just be awful if i spill my guts and he totally cops out. and what's worse is if that happens, not only are we in this class together, but we have to go to the same school for the next four years! what should i do? i don't know. i hope something happens soon that'll figure this out for me well, something good that is! i've written a lot more than twenty minutes so i should probably go now. i guess this wasn't as hard as i thought it would be. whew!

"i work at a daycare in the mornings on teusday and thursday before class and friday after class. during the day i am in my classes and at night i have meetings or readings to do. i am sytressing out right now, and i am trying to not think about how much i need to do. each time i finish with one task i feel a little better but after a few minutes i get stressed out again. i can not wait for the labor day weekend though, because i am going to spend some of time catching up with all of my readings and some of my time just relaxing. i think after labor day i will be relaxed and i will not be so stressed out with all of my work. i like my job in the mornings on teusday and thursday, i work at a daycare for infants. i work with the two months to two years, from eight in the morning until twelve-thirty in the afternoon. i like working with that age of children, because they are so trusting. they are away from their parents, but they still are so relaxed and trusting with all of the teachers at the daycare. i feel dumb writting this, because i have so much going through my mind but i can't write it all down, because most of it is the same thing over and over. wondering how i am going to finish all of my homework and go to work and go to my meetings. i geuss for the most part i am just stressing out because it is the begining of the semester, and my goal for this  semester is to make at least a 3. 75. i feel that if i get behind at the begining of the semester, i will never be able to catch up, and i will not reach my gpa goal. i am a very opptimistic person though, so i know that if i keep up with my work i will be able to reach my goal, and maybe even get higher. another thing though is that i should be a junior in years, but i am nine hours short, so over next semester and the summer i have to catch up, so that i can graduate on time. i am not worried about that, i am more concerned with my grades, because i know that i can catch up in summer, and next semester. i feel a little bit better no that i have almost completed this assignment, so that is a little off my head that i do not have to worry about. now all i have to do is read 300 pages for three more of my classes, and do the pretesting, although it won't let me on right now. maybe when i am done with this assignment i can get connected to the pretesting, but if not i will have to wait for tomorrow to do that, because right now i have to go buy some more books. then i have to go eat, because i have not eaten all day and after i eat, i have to go read about russian ecconomics. after that it will be time for class and then i have the pre-law fraternity meeting tonight. after the metting i am going to go home and go to sleep right away, because i have been up since six in the morning and i am tierd now, and i still have laods to do. so i am done with this for now, i have to get started on the rest of my schedule.

"right now i'm writing about the things i am thinking of. i just got my hair cut and now i'm drinking a coke float. which i probably shouldn't be due to the fact that freshmen 15 is a big thing these days. my boyfriend just called and i like him a lot well actually love him to death, but sometimes i just wonder like if i'm doing the right thing. actually i wonder too much instead of living life as it should be lived. now my dad is wiping the back door off because we're having a party for my grandparents tomorrow - they will have been married for 50 years - that's a long time. i'm glad that they're both still alive because a lot of people don't even get to meet their grandparents. today i went and bought some clothes, which i probably should not have because i have a lot already. this chick keeps getting on and off of aol which is really bugging me because little messages keep popping up saying she is doing this. today we had a parade in my home town. yeah i'm home again. and it was cool. kyle is a senior. i wish he was a longhorn because it would be so much easier to go to school together and see each other more often, but no he has to be an aggie. today is the football game, i wonder if texas will win. lagrange lost really bad last night - hahira their not as good as they think they are. mom is sleeping and she snores a lot. dad keeps brushing the windows now and it is somewhat distracting. coolcherrychick has just signed on. cool. lol wow my hair is really short. man i can type faster than i thought i could, i guess that's good - hey it rhymes! omg stop with the window! i can't believe i found pants long enough for me at bealls, that like never happens because i have really long legs, well not really but longer than normal. now coolcherrychick has just signed off. why do i like coke so much? i mean i don't drink it that often because i don't allow myself to, but i do enjoy it a lot - i guess the caffeine. i have problems spelling. this coke float is super good. thank god he stopped. ha-ha i just wrote stuffed before i erased it, anyway with the window. my hair is really cute, at least i think so. for once i'm not cold, its amazing. rowing is going to be cool, even though it might be really hard, at least i will have a coach forcing me to work out and i can identify with a team. i wonder if some people use really big words when trying to do this assignment, i mean i can use big words, but i really don't think in big words. my cognate. however you spell it process is not always so high smart or yeah that. i hope rhea's oh regina's home, i hope rhea's reunion - that's it - is going good, i don't think she really tried very hard but i mean she hasn't been doing her best in the recent time on being responsible. regina and laurie just got home and as i'm trying to think they are telling me about some kind of tattoo or something i don't know and i feel bad but i have to do this assignment. oh well i hope they didn't think i was being rude. this is kind of hard because i think so much faster than i type. mija just ran with laurie. she is so cute! sometimes she smells really bad though, but i guess i do to when i don't take a bath for awhile. i want to see regina's hair because she got it done today too it looks really cute and it has red in it and blonde and i think she looks good with it. kevin called today and wants mom and dad, well everyone to put their money they're contributing for grandma and grangpa's thing in cash so they can give it to them in this game show thing. the lady who did our hair is like 50 something but looks a lot younger. like 35 or 40 - no lie. well the television was just turned on and was talking about football now something is on about a comedian. i like black people, they are so much fun to be around and they are not as uptight, well when it comes to their family i guess they are but not just in general. i like jz he's cool but i don't know i think that i like all kinds of music, not any kind in particular. sometimes i feel really left out because so many people know these alternative bands, but i don't because i don't really like the music as much as i like oh wow mija is getting a bath by laurie, yeah! other music like pop and rap. it's amazing how fast this time is going by like i thought it would take a lot longer or seem like i was typing a lot longer. i like that song and i can't believe a 14 year old sings it - jojo what kind of a name is that! i like the bangs i got cut, but i don't know if i am going to be able to fix it like this myself. kyle is coming over later and i hope he likes my hair. and if he doesn't well it's not like i can do anything about it. i wish i was better at volleyball and could have done more with it. i mean i can jump high, but i can't hit hard. wow the gymnast was really short, but the volleyball player standing next to her she was so tall, i am glad i am tall, except when it comes to finding pants long enough wow i really have problems typing. today i changed in the car, that was really not fun i should have planned it better. oh well i guess no one saw and if they did then lucky them, just joking. usa wow i'm really lucky to live here and have my own choices. shampoo always smells good, well not always, but most of the time. it would be so nice to be rich. i need to read my psychology book and my biology book man both ologies, lol. breathing is a good thing. laurie can't reach the shampoo that's no fun. my fingers are starting to get tired from typing so much.

"my roommate is trying to ask me what we are going to do while i'm typing this. we played basketball for about two and a half hours. for some reason i played pretty good today, i usually don't play that good. i'm not really sure what to write, well i mean type. i went to a sorority date dash last night. it was pretty fun. they rented out some club on sixth street. i saw some people that i went to highschool with, and i didn't get home until about three so i'm really tired . i really doubt that i'll stay out that late tonight. tomorrow i'm going to san antonio for the beastie boys concert with these girls that i don't really know that well. i hope everyone has a good time. the next day is my grandpa's birthday and my entire family is going to meet at our ranch in gonzales. that reminds me i have to get him a gift. i'll get him something from ut of course probably a hat or something. my suitemates went home this weekend, one lives in arlington the other lives in deer park. they are pretty cool guys. sometimes they get on my nerves but i'm sure i get on people's nerves too. my roommate is going to a church thing right now. he said that the people there are really nice but they are extremist about how they worship, i think it makes him feel uncomfortable, i can relate i've been to some church functions like that. but he is also going because he met some girl there so he is getting the best of both worlds learning about god and hooking up with a girl. i wish i could of gone. i can hear my neighbors radio through my wall incase you wanted to know. it kind of makes me want to turn mine on since my time with you is up.

"i love college. although it is very hard work at times, you learn a lot about yourself and other people. i enjoy being in austin, although my family lives in fort worth. this is my second year hear and so far i like how things are going. of course there is always bumps on the road, but you learn to get by. sometimes i miss being home with family and friends, especially because my best friend lives in ft. worth. we've been the best of friends for nine years now. it seems like a long time. i have so many memories and i like to dwell in them from time to time. my dog ran away. i just felt like adding that in. i just came home from work and found one of my fish dead in the tank. i don't know what happened, the other two are fine. i just got these goldfish. i guess i bought them because i miss my fish back home. i have six huge goldfish back home. they have been part of our family for almost six years now. they are getting pretty old. one of them is blind, i think, because he keeps bumping in to the aquarium's glass wall. i am enjoying all my classes so far. let's see if i feel that way once testing time comes around. i am a bio major. i love biology. i think it is one of the most interesting subjects around. it is so complex and always changing. i want to go to medical school after i obtain my bio degree. i am kind of worried that i won't be accepted to any medical school. what will i do with a biology degree? i like to do research, so maybe i'll do that. i have done research in diabetes in the past. my grandmother has diabetes. i believe that is one of the reasons that i want to do research on diabetes. she lives in el salvador. it is such a beautiful country and they have the most amazing beaches. i visited my grandmother this past summer. i spend a month there. this country is developing so fast; i didn't even recognize the colony i grew up in. of course there are still some underdeveloped sections, but it seems like it's becoming more industrialized every time i visit. ok, back to medical school. being a doctor is what i have always wanted to be. sometimes i think that there is nothing else i can do. i can't wait to go to medical school and actually work in hospitals. i went to a medical profession high school. we were able to work at different hospitals. we had a fist hand look at part of the medical field. i even got to help in various procedures like suturing, administering medication, giving vaccines. what i enjoyed the most was working in the er. sometimes it is very slow, but there are times when patients are coming in left and right. i was able to help bag a patient who had just had a cardiac infarction. it became pretty stressful at times. afterwards you get a great feeling of satisfaction. i t is a feeling that you have helped someone in a time where they needed help the most. you can never forget that feeling and that is why becoming a doctor is one of the most important things in my life. besides my spiritual life, a relationship with god, and my family and friends, that feeling you get when you help a person in a crucial point is the thing i want the most.

"     today has been totally stressful!! actually this past week has been stressful! college is very different from highschool. in high school i never even had to study, but i would still make high a's in all my classes! now. . im not really prepared for all this studying i have to do in college! arg!  im pretty sure i can handle it, but im still freaking out over only taking 2 tests in each class the whole semester! and those two tests determine my grade. . thats just scary!  anyways, today in general has been stressful. my mom had to go get an mri today, and that can't be good. shes been ok the past few weeks, but something is making her sick! and today also, i found out that my uncles lung cancer is back, we thought it had gone into remission, but no, it came back. this has been really hard for my grandmother because she has to take care of my uncle 24-7. and my grandmother is not in that good health either, but hopefully she can handle all this. and it scares me because my other uncle, also smokes! even though his brother is literally deteriorating before his eyes! but he still won't stop smoking. that really pisses me off! its just so gross and. . blah. oh well, he has to make that decision on his own, i can't make it for him. anyways continuing on, one of my roomates is gettin on my nerves. i have 3 roomates in total, and we get along pretty good, but this one roomate, ahh! shes annoying! shes always trying to tell me that im not doing something right! and its always stupid stuff! like, she told me i wasnt cracking the eggs correctly?! or that my grammar on my english paper is wrong, when i know its right! and the thing that makes me mad is i didnt even want her to be my roomate. you see, i got a housing scholarship, for gettin good grades, so i don't have to live on campus. two of my other roomates got one also. the girl i don't like happened to be a recepient also. she totally butted in and said she wanted to live with me! what could i say?! noo?! of course not! so i said yes. then during the summer i was hoping she would forget and not transfer her lease over to mine, but what do you know! on moving day, guess whose face i see right as i enter my apartment door, none other than the annoying girl! ahh! this is something that is making my life even more stressful right now too!  sometimes i wish my parents could just tell me how to live my life, it would just make everything sooo much easier on everyone!  but i guess thats the college life, its just very new to me still. like, i enjoy not having my parents there telling me to study, or when my curfew is, but i do miss that   parental aspect   that i used to have in my life. college has a bunch of pluses. and minuses. its not all parties and having fun like some people. well i guess it is for some people, but personally not all that much for me. (thats another thing about my roomate. . she is always partying! like 5 days out of the week! thats overdoing it just a tad don't ya think?!?)  but anyways i guess i should write something about the psych class to get some brownie points. lol. i really like that class! its pretty interesting, and the professor is pretty cool and not so boring(like my history teacher who says. . and umm. . alot!!)im thinking of changing my major to nursing, possibly to become a psychiatric nurse, or possibly a pediatrics nurse. but im not sure(once again. . something i wish the parents could decide for me)  but yea, that class is pretty fun, i just wish it wasnt such a big class! thats another scary thing about college, your just a number! your just a tiny little fishy in a huuuge sea of other fishies!i guess its just cause im straight out of highschool where the classes are only 30 students each. going from 30, to 500, thats quite a bit of a difference, and it can be rather intimidating for a freshman!  but i guess i will have to learn how to deal with it sooner or later!! hopefully i can survive this year, my goal gpa is atleast a 3. 3 atleast! ahh!! i would like to have higher than that. . but we will just have to wait and see won't we!!

why am i doing this assignment?  i do not want to be here? i think i want to go to sleep. i wish greg would shut up so i could do my homework. when i play basketball i wish dustin would pass me the ball. but he never passes the ball so why am i complaining. my wrists hurts because the keyboard is in the wrong position. but i will not say anything because this is not my computer. i hate this keyboard because the keyboard is sorry. i wish i could go to sleep. but then again i never sleep. i wish dean would get out of this room. why did i come here?  i wish i stayed in houston. dwan needs to leave now. but he will never leave because he is going to sit down and talk. kind of like what he is doing know. i hate this song . they play this song way too much. when are they going to leave. i wish greg would turn off his computer and stop playing the music. i wish this assignment could be shorter but then again the is homework so it is not supposed to be fun. i wish i brought my own computer but i don't care. greg needs to shut up. greg is talking to one of his many girls. he has so many that people call him the mack. the computer is going to be burnt out by the time i am done with this assignment. greg better leave or i will have to beat him up. luckily greg left so i do not have to beat him up. i think my friends listen to more korean music then i do. god i wish i could get off this computer but i have to stay on here for a while. the reason is because i have to study for my chemistry quiz tomorrow. hopefully it will be easy because i do not know what is going on in that class. i need to go talk to the chemistry department about switching my chemistry teachers. hopefully they will let me because i have no clue on what is going on. today i ate some lunch around eleven o'clock. yes the food was nasty because it was from jester. i think they intentionally make the food here disgusting so that we will stop eating and study more. but i don't think so because everybody winds up either working out or playing basketball. i wish they would turn off this music because sound gay. anyway when is this assignment going to end. i really need to go study for my chemistry class. i just need to type for about ten more minutes. i wonder who this song is by?  then again why did i care it is stupid. i need to talk to someone but i lost their number so i guess i won't have my blanket. i need to find that guys number but i lost it so i guess i will never find it. i hate hot i think they are gay . so i do not know why dustin is listening to it. i wish i could take these speakers and just break them because they are so gay. why doesn't he listen to some other music that sounds better. i wish i could go back home and drive my car. i miss driving my car. i got a honda civic. it is silver and it is all mine. i am thinking about bringing it up next semester. i wish they would turn this music off but then again why do i care. i wish they would play some tupac or snoop. i have two more minutes. i wish the two minute would go by faster. i need to get some carpet for my room . i'm thinking about switching my major. i might go to business or i might just stick psychology and try to go into physical therapy after i finish college. i have one more minute left and then i am done. toad is stupid. i hate puff daddy this song is sop overplayed. ,1
"i think i have one of the shortest attention spans. for some reason i can't concentrate on one thing for more than fifteen minutes. i was never diagnosed as a. d. d. though. i don't think i'm a. d. d. i just think i don't put forth the effort to concentrate. i was trying to read for english, but i couldn't keep my mind on it for anything. every time i sat down to read i go sleepy. i try to stay focused, but it's hard. i wonder why my concentration is so limited. i think it all depends on what i'm interested in . i can read things relating to the human anatomy all day, but i have trouble focusing on things dealing with english or history. my mind often starts wondering. i've really had to adjust these first few weeks. not only did i have to adjust academically, but socially. even though i have a group of best friends, i still miss my friends back home. my mom, sister, and i are best fri3nds, and it's is pretty hard because i can't just pick up the phone and call them. it took a couple of day for me to realize this. i also have a boyfriend back home. this has also been hard. it's been hard for both of us. we were in the habit of talking everyday, and seeing each other quite often, now he's three hours away. i think he's taking it a little harder than i am. i'm keeping busy so i'm not constantly thinking about him. there's so much going on here. between keeping on top of all of my classes, and hanging out, there's no more time left in the day. we've been having so much fun. the other five girls i hang out with are great. we all bonded so quickly. they really help to keep me focused on what i need to do. of coarse with a group this big personalities flare, and we have disagreements, but surprisingly instead of holding grudges we talk it out. females are stereotyped as being gossipy, and shady. yes we do gossip, but if we say something behind someone's back, you can guarantee it's already been said to their face. so far everything's been going pretty smoothly. i hope this bond that is present now remains present for the next four years. it's difficult to say if it will because we can't  predict the future, and people change. when we're just sitting around we talk about our future as friends. i've already asked them to be bridesmaids at my wedding. who knows when that will be. i don't plan for it to be any time soon, but i do hope our friendship will at least last that long. friendship is a very important thing to me. it gives a sense of warmth, and belonging. it's like we have known each other for years. i hope nothing, but good will come out in due time.

"     well here i am, just sitting and typing. i've had a pretty long day, in fact. it was pretty horrible! thursdays are my really long days - i've got class til 7, what a drag. but the great thing is that im done for the week!  hmm, but tonight was a letdown. i was supposed to go out with this really really hot girl, but i found out that she was working - i mean, not that we had this planned, but my best friend has been pushing me to ask her out because, according to him, shes 'dying to get with me' - whatever. shes incredibly hot, and every guy wants her, so why would she want me?  thats what i think anyway. matt, my best friend, says that shes called me the hottest asian guy shes ever laid eyes on. i think thats a pretty big stretch of the truth. i think i really do have self esteem issues underneath it all. i just broke up with my girlfriend of 8 (or 9?) months. it happened over the summer. i was really in love with her. i could venture to say that i still am, but that would further jeapordize my . 05 percent chance of staying friends with her (sarcasm) - we were really good together, and when we parted ways for the summer we both cried. we had just said the big l-word that month, and in my eyes at least the relationship was just getting good. then the summer started. i was here, being back in school from a semester hiatus (to find myself, i guess. and it worked, because now i know what im doing) - thats a different story. things started out great, we would talk to each other on the phone and online whenever we could. then one day i noticed that it had been a week since we had talked to each other. this was test week for me, i believe, so my attention was elsewhere. but that isnt the reason we broke up, it was just the reason that i didnt see what was happening - when i noticed that maggie (my ex) hadnt called in awhile, i became worried and called her. she was very distant. it continued this way for another month, and i think i talked to her once during that month. then she came to visit me, and i was really excited because, while i could feel that the relationship was straining, i thought that once we saw each other things would go back to normal. boy was i wrong!  maggie walked up to me with tears in her eyes. she was hiding behind a pair of sunglasses though. the shock put me into a state of complacency. first, i totally brushed off her crying and was oddly cheerful, then she said 'let's take a walk' and it hit me like a brick wall. but i wasnt ever sad, because. i coudlnt be, i coudlnt make an emotion at all. i think that it was the closest that i've ever been to being a vegetable. all i could do was tell her things i didnt mean, like how i loved her and just wanted her to be happy, and that i wanted to be with her but not if she wasnt happy, and i could only be happy if she was happy. basically, i said the exact oppossite of everything i felt. no, i did not want to break up, yes i wnated to make things work. her reasons. her reasons were that we never fought. that we never did anything. that all we did was just be with each other and nothing else. that she had been very unhappy and got into a self-destructive lifestyle that made her look as bad as she felt. furthermore, while she was at home she made a lot of new friends and for once she felt like she was accepted. i think i hit everything, im not sure, but all her reasons made no sense to me - ok, we never did anything, but 1) i always wanted to go out, and she was always too tired. she would crawl into my arms and we would just lay in bed, watching tv 2) she came over to be depressed with me, and she got what she wanted, i mean, there was nothing i could do to make her have fun. and she was unhappy, but so was i (i was kicked out of school!) - put 2 unhappy people together and. well you get the idea. but you know what? - i saw that too, and i wanted to make things work this fall, because i knew that we would both be better individuals (damn my optimism). and she said that she got into a self-destructive lifestyle (she meant eating takeout all the time and just sitting on our asses, doing nothing, gaining weight) - 1) maggie is incredibly good looking, very pretty, and i told her that a lot because its true. she has a very low self esteem, just like i do, so maybe im being a hypocrite. and the 'weight' she gained was easily lost as is apparent by the last time i saw her, about 2 weeks ago. and the last part is the coldest one of all, but i don't think i meant much to her, i mean, i was her first boyfriend, and i thought we meant a lot to each other, but i guess when i told her how great she was, it meant nothing. it wasnt until she had a whole bunch of random guys back home tell her that it sunk in, and i guess suddenly she saw all these other choices. really, all her excuses boiled down to the fact that she has her pick of any guy, and that all of a sudden her love and affection for me seemed, to her, to be misplaced. i just think that i was thrown to the curb for someone better, but who knows!  im still in love with her, and im trying to chase after ashley for all the wrong reasons. just because i need a girl in my life. but more than anything, i want maggie back. god, were not even friends anymore, and thats what we were both trying to never ",1

"i thought i could cry forever and i wanted to until i feel eased and better. i guess that made me feel at least somewhat better since i don't feel as depressed or sad right now. i saw mo and ricky this morning. mo probably thinks i've gotton weird, edged, or i don't know, just crazy and there's something wrong with  me. yeah. there's definitely something wrong with  me. i wanted to talk to him so much. i miss him so much when i don't see him and i don't see him as much or at least i don't try as much to see him or hang out with  him. before hanging out with  him was one of my better comfort or pleasure, but it hurts me now to him. he is, to me, one of my best friend and i care for him a lot. i want the best for him and he doesn't deserve a person like me. i am so confused. i am so depressed. i know that i should talk to people about it but it isn't so easy after all. connie doesn't understand or i know understand her. i tried so hard for her but she seems so insensitive or she is being a jerk on purpose to be insensitive to me. i don't even think she knows what she's doning to me. god please help me to get through this time. i truly believe that only you could help me and pull me through this misery. i miss feeling your awesome love. i feel so lonely. i feel bad but i can't really talk to my mom about this my whole crazy situation. she expects so much out me. she loves me so much that it hurts her so much to see me being like this. but lord, i really don't know what i can do. i don't think i am capable of doing anything well or at least i don't have any desire to do anything. i thought mom was okay with  elementary education and i thought i could do that, but she says, """"no, no!"""" to it. what can i do?  i really want to be the daughter my parents want me to be. i really want to be a friend all my other friends want me to be. i really want to be a sister sungmin and sungchan want me to be. but most of all, i really really want to be someone that i want to be that will please everyone and the most of all you. i am so confused. lord i don't know what to do and this makes me a sad, depressed and unhappy person. i don't have any motivation to do anything and this is so hard because the school has already started. whenever i feel like i want to cry or feel down i want to go to certain people like timmy, steve, mo, betty, connie, mom, and etc. but timmy, as much as i want to go to him, i can't for some reason. instead, i'm so mean to him. i don't mean to be. i hope he knows it. i wonder if he still likes me. i sometimes feel like he does, but i don't think so anymore. guys are so frickle. steve. i want to but i can't depend on him too much because he will be married soon and i shouldn't be near him so much. mo. i want to but you are one of my problems. why can't you be just a friend to me. betty and connie. i shouldn't talk to them so much, in fact, i kind of regret telling them so much about me. i shouldn't have. oh well, they are my friends and i hope they don't ruin my trust on them. well, i feel so much better just writing about everyting or most of the things that bothered me for so long. i guess my 20 minutes are up. maybe things will be better today.

"right now, i am in a really good mood, i don't really know why because this morning i was so dead, and i thought i would feel like that all day, but i woke up sometime between biology and economics. last night sucked. everyone else was having so much fun, but i was exhausted and just couldn't really get into it. i don't know how people do it every night!  i am so worn out every day!  i just need to take a few days off to sleep. i am so mad that our zeta retreat is the weekend of austin city limits!  i have to get out of it somehow. my stomach kind of hurts right now, and i really need to go running, so i hope it goes away. my friend megan has an eating disorder i think. she constantly tells us how much weight she is lost recently, and its getting so annoying. i really miss zachary. thank god he called and woke me up this morning or else i would have never woken up. and i really miss my dog. i think i have an unhealthy relationship with my dog. thank god i'm taking psychology. haha i literally miss her more than my parents!  i hope fiji is fun tonight. it probably will be. i always have the most fun with the fiji guys. they are so nice and fun to hang around with. it is such a nice day outside. i would much rather be out enjoying it then writing this. just kidding!  it was not cool last night when so many people came into my room and woke me up! i was in such a deep sleep too! no wonder i was tired this morning. okay now my roommate is going outside. just like i wanted to!  she is cool as shit. she is just so herself, and i think that's awesome. sometimes i wish i could be more like that. i am a fairly independent person, but i know i follow the trend a lot too. i hope i do well at the tryouts for the dance team. that would be so cool! i miss dance so much!  i can't believe i quit - i am such an idiot! dance was always such an outlet for me and when i quit, things kind of started going downhill, so hopefully i can start back up. i seriously think i've gained the freshman 100!  for some reason when i get stressed out i start to eat. a lot. i need to get control!  i think its so funny how all of the girls from hardin house and srd are constantly at towers. i love living here, it is so free and fun all the time. it's so weird how music means so much to some people and so little to others. i think i'm kind of in between. i love music, but it certainly isn't my life. there are definitely times in my life when music plays a key role. ugh. cooper, why did he become so annoying!?  he used to be so funny and nice. i wonder what my sister is doing right now. i miss her about the same as i miss my pooch. she is so sweet. i hope she is okay. i worry about her all the time, i just hope she is okay. it worries me how introverted she is. i am the complete opposite!  i spill my guts to anyone that will listen and she won't open up to anybody. i know that she is going through a really hard time right now with mom and papa, and with me leaving. god she looked up to me so much :(  i really need to stretch. i think running will be good for me today. i need to burn off some steam for sure. i wonder how molly is doing. i haven't talked to her in awhile. i feel bad because she called me a lot when school started, and i was always so busy and couldn't' ever call her back. now she hasn't been answering when i call, so i hope she is at least having fun. i bet she is met so many hot colorado guys. why can't i find a guy?  they are all so worthless. all the freshmen guys care about right now is pledging and getting a piece of ass. both of which i am not going to do right now. well except for pledging. duh. zeta. why didn't i get my first choice!  i really want to know what i did wrong. all of my friends got their first choice, and i am really nice and outgoing, it should have been a breeze. why did i spill my guts that night about it to nathan. i am such a dumbass. oh well, it happens to the best of us. well time to go run!

"as i sit here to begin writing, i was stood up for a date this weekend. i know this happens all the time, but still it hurt. and i don't know why. i mean its not like i need love and attention all that much. okay, so maybe i do. but is that so bad. but it seems that everytime i find someone who does love me i find a way to push them away. i don't know. maybe i'm not meant to be happy. i really do hate being so dependant. and i don't know why i am. maybe its genetic. maybe not. maybe i'm just becoming one of those messed up people i never wanted to become. who knows. usually when i write stream of consiousness it turns very melodic and down trodden. i guess this keyboard messing up might be helping things. i don't know. i'm not really tired, but i have so much to do. and i do want to get some sleep. maybe getting dumped on some is good for me, maybe it will wake me up. maybe i am dreaming too much. maybe none of this is real, and i'm jus+t fooling myself. who knows, i surely don't. but its kinda bad being so dependant, especially when you don't attract girls by the dozen. but i can not help it, its who i am. a hopeless romantic, lost in a non romantic world. oh, for the days of the cowboys. when men were men. or medevil times, with knights, and damsels. and fuedal kingdoms. and the plauge. ring around the rosey. ugh. i hated that game as a child. but now i think its kinda fun. i dunno, i jus+t want someone to share with, to be with. maybe thats too much to ask out of every girl's best friend. sigh. i really don't want to go to work tommorrow. i mean i do okay, at it. but i'm just not annoying enough to be really good at it. plus i guess there's no incentive. i don't know if i want to go back to dallas on the first. i'm not sure if i want to go back period. don't get me wrong. i mean i miss some of the people. but i want to get past mesquite. to move on with my life. i guess i have a lot of trouble moving on. but somtimes people jus+t make it too hard. this is a very pretty song. i may ask mandy out. as a matter of fact, i think i will. but is it wrong??  i don't know. i'm not s+ure if i'm qualified to say. i'm not sure who is. i've done so many things that i said id never do. oh man. am i messed up??  isn't that somthing we are always asking ourselves though???  or at least it seems i am. i mean i have never loved anyone the w4ay i loved kara, since kara, if that makes any sense. i'm just so utterly confused at the moment. i don't know. plus i have too much to do to be w4orrying about all this. life should be so easy right now. i should be having a ball. but i'm not. and i hate it.

"well after labor day weekend i had come to the conclusion that i disliked the college life. everything had gone so wrong that weekend. the book store sent me home with the wrong book, i didn't have my """"if"""" account so i couldn't check my email, and i bought a twenty dollar calling card that is supposed to be better than the one i had been buying and it was a rip off. the tendollar card had more minutes on it than than the twentydollar card, and to top that off the darn thing only had sixteen dollars on it. so my weekend was just a bunch of carp. i am not exactly home sick, but i do miss my baby brother and my fianc'. i went home this past weekend, missed the first football game here, and saw the two people i missed most. it was so cool to be home everybody was so happy to see me, it was great. i am planning on joining a sorority here to keep me busy so i won't get home sick. i haven't really met anyone here yet. the girls on my floor aren't very friendly. when i first got here i was bored out of my mind, but now things are looking better. i am not real in to sixth street, but the first week i was here some friends that live here took me there. i got my tattoo on sixth street when we were here for orientation. i keep saying we, my best friend and i that is. my best friend is my roommate and she is trying to get me to enjoy it here and not miss home too much. i have to say i do like the fact that my parents can't tell me what to do, and when to be home and all the other things that parents tell their kids to do. i was ready to get away and be on my own. my fianc' is at home going to school there. hopefully he will come up here next year. we are supposed to get married this summer, but i guess we will have to see what happens. it is so weird to see everyone outside smoking in the middle of the night, and to see people going out at three in the morning. at home we have a curfew, and they are real strict about it too. other than all that stuff, i am adjusting pretty well to the college life and am learning to love it. things can only get better, right. i know i made it sound like i just hate it here, but i don't. the weekend at home was enough to hold me off for awhile. that one bad weekend made me think that it was always going to be like that. next time i will be writing about how much i love it here, and i won' t have anything to complain about.

"right now i am really hungry. i would go eat right now but i am going to run with the marathon team tonight. i ran cross country in high school and was pretty good but i did not run during the summer. lets hope i'm still in shape. probably not, i'm going to have to start back at the beginning with two or three miles and work my way up again. this stream of consciousness in not fun. my thoughts are coming out too fast for my to type. it's like when i'm writing an english paper. i'll get a great idea in my head then not able to write it down fast enough and i forget it. good thing you aren't checking spelling and punctuations and stuff life that. i hate typing on the computer, well not typing but talking on the computer. the i'm stuff instant messaging. my roommate keeps asking me questions while i'm doing the writing. she talks on i'm all the time. she spends more time in the room on the computer than i do and that's hard to do. she wakes up in the morning and turns on her computer to see if anybody is online that she can talk to. it's 8 o'clock in the morning does she really think anybody is going to be on. i never liked talking on i'm and i've tried to. i think many of the things i say are sarcastic and it is hard to show that what you are typing has a sarcastic tone. so i pissed of a few people even though i was being sarcastic. and it could be that i am quiet and don't talk that much unless it's about sports or something. i'm weird, i think i'm the only girl in the dorm that likes to watch football and other sports. i have always liked to watch sports. and i pretty much know that i am the only girl that likes to play football on play station 2. i've always liked playing video games. like right now i have grand theft auto vice city on my computer. it is a lot of fun. i love playing. i see it as a stress relief for me. when i had a hard day i'll start play the game run from the cops then feel better. i am able to do things in the game that i would never do in real life. i would never be stupid enough to run from the cops in real life and that's why i like to do it in the game because i can and will not get punished for it. the people who go around saying the game should be band because it is violent and gives people bad ideas make me mad. even though there are people in the game you can tell they are fictional. all the cops look the same, all the pedestrians look the same. you can tell that this is not real life. if you are running from the cops in the game you can drive around and pickup police bribes which lowers your wanted level and less cops chase after you. now i know that does not happen in real life. there are clear distinctions between the game and real life. i know those distinctions and would not cross them. some bad apples that were probably high or drunk anyways that ran from the cops and blamed it on the game should not ruin if for other who think the game is fun.

"ok, so i'm sitting here wondering what i'm going to eat for dinner, even though i'm not hungry. my roommate just told me what there is at jester and she also told me that she waited to do her homework until i woke up because she didn't want the printer to wake me up. she is so sweet. she has selfesteem issues that she takes medication for and for the life of me i can't understand people like this. it's like i want to just tell them to snap out of it. it's very frustrating for me because i don't understand it. she and i talked about this issue last night before we went to sleep. i told her how i felt and we've come to an understanding. i'm starting to miss my parents. i feel very sad for my mother because i know she misses me a lot. i don't tell my mother often enough how much i love and respect her i should do this. i stood in line for an hour today for football tickets for the ou game in dallas. i love it here but it will be nice to return to a place i am so familiar with. i hope liz forgets about her exboyfriend aaron. she is so cool. i am really glad we met one another. he is such a weirdo and she is so smart and independent and ambitious. i don't see how she does it. i mean, she's doing the kvr tv station thing and comm council and an internship at the capitol, and 14 hrs. and she just has to obtain a 4. 0 or she'll just die. me on the other hand, i'm just trying to make it here. i'm used to doing it all. i handled everything going on in high school, but that was dealing with 300 people and easy classes that i swore were hard. i just really hope i make the novice rowing team here. i've put so much time and energy in preparation for tryouts. i work out everyday and go out of my way to get noticed. liz just called about us going to get our meningitis shots tomorrow. i also need to get my chicken pox vaccination because i've never had them and i don't want to get them now, because i'm afraid i'll like die or something. my mother should have exposed me to them when i was a child. i just saw julie and she wasn't very nice. i hope she's not mad at me. i have to go to the boathouse and run a lot tomorrow and i'm sitting here dreading it. but, if i make the team it will all be worth it. my roommate snores really loud at night. i plug my ears with cotton. it angers me. it's very difficult to sleep. i have so many things to do. i feel like there aren't enough hours in the day to do what i need to get done. austin is really hot. i hope eddie and lydia work things out. he loves her so much and i really want them to be together. i'm thinking about the ou game again. i am so excited to see him and my other cousin. they are big ut fans. they are so happy that i am going here. i almost feel bad, because i guess i didn't really consider it that big of a deal that i got in. everywhere i go, people look at me in awe when i tell them i go to school here. well, i'm going to stop writing now. it's been 20 minutes and all i can think about is all the stuff i have to do now. i have journalism, rhetoric and geography homework so i'm going to get started.

"     the library is so boring. i can't stand more than two hours of library a day. daily discussion sections can be really useless in the long run for easy classes, one would be better off studying. it is hard to write a stream of consciousness when typing and especially being in a library with other people around you. there are too many distractions and i believe this particular writing assignment to be more effective on my behalf in a different environment. time is tricky in that it seems to move by faster than expected when it is divided into units, i divide my day into units of time rather than just saying that i have to be in class for an hour, i consider this one unit of time and everything just works out as planned. i wonder if people have a preference on which computer to use when they enter a computer lab, i mean location of the computer, i have a preference for the computers in the back corner or at least at the end of the row. i have am uncomfortable with people sitting behind me or even next to me when there is a chance i may be watched. i am not really following the rules of stream of consciousness because i am using punctuation marks and there is no real stream with punctuation marks. it is hard not to, may be there is something psychologically wrong with a person who  uses punctuation in a stream of consciousness one thing is for certain is that the person may be a little occupied by trivial matters. a beautiful girl just walked in so she is on my mind so since she is on my mind i will write about her, she is wearing a black dress, knee high and a tan beld with tan shoes, i wonder why she dressed like that to go to the library and use a computer, awesome she is now sitting at the computer next to me if i wasnt in a stream on consciousness may be i would talk to her, probably not i am not good with those type of situations anyway, i guess i shouldnt write about her when she may glance over and see my writing about her enough of that, where was i in my original thoughts before this incident occured, i believe i was talking about time and how controlling it can be when dealt with in the wrong way our whole society is so structured on this intangible object its amazing when you dwell and also can get confusing. i think i may just move to spain where time is not that big of a deal, at least thats what my high school sociology teacher told me, she was an attractive lady who had just got out of college and she really liked me, not in a sexual way, she had a wonderful family, and her child was very beautiful, i hope one day i may have the chance to have such a nice child. anyway, our relationship was good, she even invited me to the movies and many dinners at her house, it was awkward, but  i soon became kind of close with that family, she knew my mother was living in austin and wanted to just kind of have the experience of a teenage son i guess i recall those two years and i feel extremely happy and encouraged by that woman and she helped me deal with not having a mother ",0
" the past week i have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. i am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. i so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason i keep holding myself back. this frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. my presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. i'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. i really don't think that it's me. my suitemate is about to push me over the edge. she never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. for example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. on most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. she just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. she is from beverly hills. im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. typical if you ask me. i just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. on top of that, i am homesick. i miss my friends. i miss being with richie. he'll call me once and a while. usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then i won't hear from him for quite a while. i get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. that makes me so mad. my roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. it just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but i know that he cares about me. if he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. it really makes me wonder why she is the one person i confide in the most. speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom i adore as a friend. he is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. i turn around and he is always there. i never get to sleep in my own room, i am constantly forgotten about or simply not included in activities that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. i find it ironic that she gets mad at me when i talk to richie, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when i make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. it doesn't seem all that fair to me. but then again, what is fair?  is it fair that i want to be with someone that i can't have anymore? no its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. sometimes i wonder if i will ever get a break; if maybe one day i'll get lucky and things will turn out the way i wanted them to, or if maybe richie will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. sometimes i wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. she and i couldn't possibly be more different than we are. i can't even believe that i am her child sometimes. she acts so much like a child. if she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. she denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. i think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. i want to tell her how i feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that i need. she always used to do that in high school. if i told her what was on my mind, she would take away my car, or my privileges to stay out late. i can never win. its either   give up my priviliges   or keep my mouth shut. it is a lose lose situation. i just miss richie so much. that could be the root of all my unhappiness. my mom, and suitemate could all just be elements of my sadness due to my distance away from him. he called me today. ironically i was lying in bed thinking about him, when the phone rang. it felt so good to see his name on my cell phone when i looked at it.

"hi, when i think of this type of writing i think of a project that my little sister did once. she is very interested in psycology and writing. for a class she had to do this and i thought it was very strange. right now i am watching the cowboys game. they suck. i love football, but the cowboys have lost all respect as a team because of the actions of their players. troy aikman is kind of cute and emmit smith is a really nice guy but all the others don't really impress, it is half time right now. my boyfriend plays football for st. marks. i love him because he is my best friend and he is so sweet to me. my friends keep giving me crap because we talk to each other all the time, but i can't imagine not talking to him. last night at the pike bbq thing, jerry jeff walker played and that was cool, except that i had cramps and felt bad and wes had not called so i was mifted. i knew that he was having fun wiht the boys, but i still wanted to hear from him, i am not sure that i am doing this assignment correctly because it is hard to just write what comes to mind, you know. i fell like i am typing this to someone who is going to read it and so i don't know what to put. i am so tired right now. i went to church this morining with a friend of mine who made me go. (i told her to make me go)  the pastor talked about dying and how our spiritual goal in life is to die. i had issues with that; i don't think i was as openminded as i could have been because i was tired and hungry and grumpy and i had not talked to wes this morning. my roommates phone is ringing,  i like my roommate a lot , but when he phones ring all night it can be annoying,  we are having fun together though she likes to party a little more than i do. that's okay. i am not that big of a party girl and i think that my friends think i am a party pooper. oh well, i did not party hard in high school so why start now. i know how to have fun, but i came here to get an education, so studying an dmaking my grades is the most important. my best friend kathleen went to harvard and she has not called me or talked to me yet. i like her but sometimes she can be very difficult to talk to i think that she was very jealous of my relationship wiht wes. i am tired adn bored oh well  there are some very ood commercials on the television. i know we weren't supposed to correct our typing, but i am a perfectionist. that is a major character flaw i am not that bad any more, however i am editing this little paper as i go,  i mean that i am just correcting my spelling, i wish that i knew how to type really fast,  liek super fast. wes thinks that i am super fine like the sugar i bought to put in my tea. wow dallas is getting their butts kicked i normally would cuss a little in describing the cowboys, but i don;t knonw if that is appropriate for this assignment, i guess it does not matter one damn bit because it is not like anyone will read this. anyway, our pledge retreat was fun, okay this tyoing thing sucks. i have no idea what i am thinking. that is what i am thinking i get to go home and see wes's football game against kinkaid. i hope that they win. okay why the hell has he not called me yet. this is very frustrating i know that he is busy but i would like to hear from him yea only one more minute. kick ass. i love that phrase it is fun to say. my roommates phone keeps beebing and it is driving me crazy, well not really  but that was just something to type. okay time is up bu-bye  i like that way of saying bye,  the red skins just scored,  okay really bu-bye this time.

"i've been thinking a lot about this next weekend. tryint to plan everything out so i get to see everyone. i miss home. the people, the places. my church, my room, and all the little things too. just the familiar surroundings that make home what it is. so peaceful. so safe. one things i've found at college is that there's a void in my life that can't be filled. it won't ever be tha same. the relationships with people back home, that's the biggest void of them all. susan, amy, jennifer, john, mikey, jeni, ms. betty, my parents. you can't replace that. it's always there, just sitting, empty. sure, i can meet new people, do new things, but you can never replace a person, a relationship. they're all differnt and unique. my left arm is tired. well, i just thought that so i figured i'd write it. and i just thought about writing about my arm. wow!  and i just thought about thinking about writing about my arm. it never ends. weird. i've always been interested in how the human minds works. it's funny when you think about it. here we are, using our minds, trying to figure out how our own minds work!  isn't that weird?  when you think about it, where do you get yourself?  how can you come to a conclusion when the conclusion you're trying to come to, is actually the tool you're trying to come to that conclusion with?  it's impossible. an endless cirlce of thought and ideas. the human mind is a mystery, and always will be. that kind of impresses me that i came with that. gee, i'm smart. just kidding. well. ten more minutes. ok, i ;ve gone from missing home to pondering about the human mind. my shoulder hurts. wow, i complain a lot. i'm feeling my elbow right now. it's swollen or something. i'm not sure why. i've been working out a lot so that might have something to do with it. who knows?  it doesn't hurt, but i don't know if i should avoid straining it or what. i'm supposed to work out today. we'll see. i've been thinking about someone back home a lot. her name is cam and we met about a month before i left for college. there was this kind of initial attraction i guess you'd say. kind of weird. i haven't had anything like that in a couple of years. i think it was her bright personality. she has thing kind of glow about her. she's always laughing. i like that in people, because i need to laugh more sometime. so we kind of talked about our relationship some, and i told her i didn't think it was best if we committed to anything, i mean, since i was leaving for college. she's a junior in high school. but we've kept in touch a lot. i think she wants a committment, but i don't think that's smart. but you know, there are sometimes when what is smart isn't what is right. sometimes we have to do the irrational and just dive in without holding back. it's like faith. god doesn't always make sense to me. i hear all the time people trying to disprove god, or christ, or the bible, or christianity. like i'm taking this class, the rise of christianity, and he always tries to show flaws in the bible or myths about the early churches, or whatever. but the fact is this:  i know what jesus has done in my life, and nothing can change that. ever!  what he did was illogical, it was beyond understanding, it was a miracle!  and nothing can disprove that, not science, not anything. how do people react to that then?  well, people's final defense is usually, """"well, then you must be crazy. """"  and if that's all they have, then i'll take that any day. times up. hey, i liked this assignment. i think i will enjoy this class. ",1
"the first thought that enters my mind is that i have no idea what i am going to say in this assignment. i have no thoughts or feelings except that i am trying to think about what to say. these types of assignments are difficult for me because i usually concentrate on a concrete task, not writing down random thoughts. because i am a guy, sex just popped into my head. because i am male, i hope i do not have to write down everytime this happens in the next nineteen minutes. for the next nineteen minutes, the only feelings i will have are those of confustion and befuddlement, for lack of anything to say. this being my first college writing assignment, i am a little nervous that i may be doing this wrong. i must change my previous statement that i am confused. it is more of a fear that i will do this assignment wrong and not receive credit for it. my next thought was to look at the clock and see how much time i had left. only fourteen minutes left. yahoo.   i just wondered if there was going to be a volleyball game at the gym tomorrow. it is not that i like volleyball, but that it takes away the gym at gregory for playing basketball, which is my favorite thing to do on weeknights. (eleven minutes left. i can't wait). i just glanced back at the prompt and realized that it is impossible to not think about grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. this is not a warning usually associated with a writing assignment, and therefore it will probably be focused on more because of it. i just saw an empty dr. pepper can in the garbage can and i thought i might like one, but then i realized that i wanted to finish this assignment before getting one. my next thought was that i wish i had a thesaurus right now because i have used the word """"assignment"""" too many times. excuse me, someone just knocked on the door. it was one of my roommate's friends who scares me because i believe he might go """"postal"""" at anytime. i had a thought before this person came to the door, but i forgot it now. it's okay because i only have to write for seven more minutes. i am wondering what my """"quote of the day"""" will be on my board outside my dorm. i want to use a quote from the movie """"what about bob"""" but i'm afraid it will be too long to fit on the board. again, i am having the problem of not knowing what to say. it must stem from my lack of self-esteem. i just glanced at the clock and found that i only have to write for two more minutes. i just realized that i should not have written that down because i could have stopped then and you wouldn't have known but now you will expect at least a few more sentences. if this """"assignment"""" was supposed to show me how my mind works, i am not pleased with the results. it shows me that my mind does not work that well at all. my only """"sensation"""" in the last twenty minutes is that i have to go to the bathroom     ",0
"i feel really weird having to write something. pressure?  yeah. my   dormmates   are so loud. i can hear the tv blaring through the door right now. they woke me up this morning (on several accounts. )  i have to get used to this (or they have to shut up! :) )  my dad called right as i started this. i would really like to talk to him, but i turned my phone off. hopefully i can get through to him after i finish with this. i'm a really fast typer, this thing will probably be really long. maybe i should slow it down some. i was really suprised that my dad called. i thought that i sent him a pretty nasty e-mail last night about paying for my books (i'm really just mad at him because he hasn't made the effort to come up and see me yet. )  but he sent me back another e-mail saying that he would give me the check for my books tomorrow. when he came up for lunch. damn!  i hate it when he does that too me. just when he fits the perfect category of a bastard father and i have a legitimate reason for hating him he pulls some shit like this. also, looking back at my e-mail it wasn't nasty at all. why can't i just tell him how i feel. it's a shame that no one in the psych department is going to read this, because i'm sure that one could do some serious psycho-analysis on the way i feel about my father. i would really love to do research on girls from families where the father   abandoned   the family. see how they turned out in their romantic'sexual relationships, how they relate to other men. i know that i would probably be the perfect sterotypical   i don't have a daddy   girl. insatiable sexual appetite, emotional codependency, needing to constantly be reassured that the ones i love most won't leave me. it makes me really sad what my dad has done to me. i don't think it's ever really angered me (i don't know that i've actually ever been really angry at anything), but it makes me almost stiff with sadness. my roomate just walked in totally throwing my stream of consciousness off, but i think i was probably done with that thought anyway. i don't know what i'm going to do with my college education. there's just so much that i could see myself being really happy doing. i would love to go into print journalism (write for a newspaper or a magazine), psychology (what i talked about earlier), teaching (i don't know why. i just love kids and i feel that i'm a really good teacher), then there's politics. i could really see myself getting into a campaign. but last night i had a dream, so real that earlier today i couldn't remember whether it had really been a dream that i just had to get into the college of communications. i wonder if that holds any weight to what i really want to do. how logical does it sound to make a career descision on a dream?  some might say that it's very logical, like mom. i love her so much. i remember when i was a freshman in high school and brainwashed by fbba, and we would get into these huge religious debates. now i think that there may be more truth to what she thinks than what i believed. i miss her and austin so much that it hurts. i'm cryng now just thinking about it. after the divorce, we became a unit. now i can't help but feel that that unit is slowing crumbling. i miss how austin would always make me laugh. he's so goofy. i remember when football was on he would pile up thed cushions from the sofa and dive into them. i feel like a little piece of me has died, even though he's only 2 1'2 hours away. who is this close to their brother?  but, mom was never home and for the past 2 years i've kind of raised him. i remember when he and i would commisserate about how much he and i hated roisin. i feel realy bad for not being able to get ahold of her before i left. i guess i probably could have tried harder. that's my problem. i get so close to being a good person, or being a sociable person as is the case at school, but i never follow through with what i say i will. i wonder if that has anything to do with dad never doing the same thing?  i am so excited about american idol coming on tonight. less than 2 hours. i really hope that kelly winds. i miss kenny and bevin. i'm not really sure that she wants me as her bridesmaid, or if she's just doing it because kenny asked richard to be his groomsman. when i call them she never seems to want to talk to me. oh well, she asked me and there's nothing that she can do about it now. well, i guess there is. i want to get married. to richard. and i want to raise a family. i want a dog. i want to be happy. i want to watch our 4 kids grow up and have kids of their own. i would really love to be in huntsville with him right now. i wish that i could life the ut campus and set it back down in huntsville. i mean, i love ut but i hate having to be so far from richard. it was really fun this weekend staying with him. i do feel really bad about giving that guy my number. he called last night and he talks as if he was really slow. oh well. i know i won't follow up on it. and why would i?  i'm in a very serious, very committed relationship. and i love richard very very much. i really believe that he is my soulmate ",1
"for instance, adjusting to the enormous crowd of students and coping with the overcrowded lecture halls has been extremely difficult. in addition, meeting new friends has also presented another challenge for me because i live off campus. i attempt to meet new people in my classes; however, it seems i haven't established any new friendships yet. however,  i will continue my efforts throughout the semester. furthermore, i have been overwhelmed by the hours of homework i have been assigned each evening. it is a drastic change from my responsibilities in high school. i have made a strong commitment to myself to succeed- no matter the obstacles i encounter. i have dreamed of earning my degree at the university of texas since i was a small child. as i grew into a young adult, i never let go of my aspiration to attend the university. my unceasing desire motivates me to apply my abilities and employ my talents to surpass all odds. i will accomplish my goals and i will prove to myself and family i can do anything that i put my mind to. when i get discouraged, i refer to the scripture, """"i can do all things through christ who strengthens me. """"  i know i can succeed at the university of texas with my sincere desire and strong determination. ",1
"okay, so we're supposed to write for twenty minutes about nothing really. it's a show about nothing-seinfeld. that is an episode for all you non-seinfeld watchers out there. you really should watch it though. it is really funny. i like funny. funny is good. i am trying to type fast without looking at the keys and it is not working. alessandra thinks she's so cool cause she typed faster than me in micro computer applications last year. i wasn't a very fast typer. i am stupid because i forgot to look to see what time i started writing. i am going to assume that i've only been writing for about three to five minutes. at least i am getting this done though. i have to go to psychology class in forty five minutes. last class we took these tedious surveys for eligibility  in experiments. it wasn't fair because there were like 2-3 surveys for just girls. so all the guys got finished and left to go take naps or eat. speaking of eating, we ordered poky sticks from gumby's pizza last night. i hope the roommates pay me back for that. but i don't want to be rude and ask for the money. i am really cheap. but it is all coming out of my spending money. my friends are all getting money from their parents. my dad is being annoying though. he wants me to learn to budget my own money. he would have given me so much a month if my older sister hadn't told him that she didn't get any money her first year in college. those older siblings cant just be happy for the younger ones can they. everything has to be fair, doesn't it. oh well. i shouldn't be complaining i guess. i am getting to go to the school i wanted to go to. i am getting the feeling that people around me are trying to read what i am writing. i know they're not though. they have better things to do i'm sure. i'm just paranoid i guess. today is thursday. we have a floor meeting tonight. a chance to meet our neighbors. warning !!! when you log out all your files will be erased!! that is what the sticker on this computer says. i think they are over-using  exclamation marks there. but that is just my opinion. i am not really one to use exclamation marks very freely. i think it is raining. i had to walk back from the library yesterday in the pouring rain with my roommate. she is pretty cool. she smokes too much though. i am trying to break her of that horrible habit. i think she is just getting annoyed with me though. she has bad posture. we've bonded already. i m glad i didn't get some kinda weirdo for a roommate. she says she is getting a haircut today. then again she has been saying that for the past two days. i really need to spit this gum out. i've been chewing it for almost two hours. some random guy gave it to me when i was waiting to go to my boring english class. i need a computer in my room. my mom says she bought me a lava lamp for my room. i really want her to come down and drop it off, but i don't want her to stay for the weekend. i am getting very sleepy. this staying up until 2am every night cant keep up for much longer. i have about five more minutes to write. what else should i write about. i feel like a lab rat. are people going to read this later on and analyze me. will they get in contact with me if they find out that i have some kind of mental illness? or will they just forget about it and write a book about me? my shoes are stiff from the rain yesterday. and i have to go to the bathroom really bad. gotta spit this gum out. i am getting antsy. i think its been twenty minutes. this was fun.

"for some reason today i feel more home sick than i have yet. when i first arrived to my dorm room three weeks ago, it didn't feel very real to me. of course i cried when my parents left, but it wasn't because i was feeling all the things that i thought i would. at the time i think it was more knowing that i would soon feel that way once the excitement wore off. now, dorm life is very real and i no longer feel like i am at summer camp. the first two weeks were nothing but meeting new people and going new places and now i feel the overwhelming feeling of college work and homesickness. it is rather silly i guess for me to say """"homesick"""" because i am only thirty miles away from home, but i have discovered that it doesn't really matter what your distance from home is. distance would make it harder, but for all of us it is the fact that we are no longer living with our families; we will never be living under our parents permanently. in a way i guess i am supposed to be really excited about that and i think i am, but i also really miss being a bigger part of their lives. so much happens on a daily basis and i feel like i am missing something. i also wonder if it is really weird for me to feel this way. so many of the other students seem to be having the time of their lives, but i wonder if they have ever felt the same way. i went to eat with my mom and sisters last night because my older sister was in town from college station. after we ate i couldn't fight the tears that were welling up in my eyes. i miss old times like that and i miss the way we could just laugh together and have fun. i know that soon i will be adjusted to my new life and i can look back on this and think what a dork i was. it is just that time of adjustment and waiting until this place feels like home. i want so badly for it to feel like home and i want to be happy here. i really have no doubt that it soon will be a place where i feel comfortable, i just hope that soon comes really soon! my mom keeps sending emails telling me to have fun. it isn't that easy to just make friends and go have fun. i never thought that it would be so hard to meet people, but with such a huge population it can't be easy. i think that i am probably complaining too much because i really am not unhappy by any means but i just expected something different. high expectations are dangerous because nothing can ever be as good as you dream it to be. oh well, hook 'em horns!

"today is september 11th. i was reading some articles on msn. com about whether or not we should commemorate this. i had a class at 9:30--i wish i didn't have to wake up for this class. it seems like whenever i have to wake up for a class it drains me of energy. i'm glad that the only other class i have is in the afternoon today. speaking of which i'm going home for the weekend--that makes me happy because i will get away from everything related to ut austin. my roommate was in the room, he just left. i am writing on my laptop--it's very hard to use this keyboard. i am tired right now. i don't know what to do. i have calculus homework to do. i feel like it has been looming over my head. i can't wait to go to home. i feel more comfortable here at ut now. i think i'm getting along with everyone. i don't feel stressed out anymore. i feel like there is nothing to be bummed out about. i will find what i like to do here. i might join the badminton club. that sounds like fun because i used to play badminton and now i don't anymore. i don't play it anymore because i don't feel like it. being at ut is a lot of walking, i'm tired cause of it. i think a lot of my thoughts are being filtered when i'm typing. i am indian. my parents are from india. they are very nice people and they are at home. sometimes i feel like they miss me and i miss them. i am going back to see them. i am getting tired of typing on the keyboard. i think i am a smart person. i wonder if other people think i try to act smart. i don't really care if they do. i'm just being myself. i get along with others. i don't think i will be completely satisfied in life thinking i have to be something when i grow up. i should just stay happy as i am right now. i think that would be a good life plan. just take it easy. that's what i'm doing right now. my computer is a dell and it's a laptop--with a small keyboard. i got it new. my roommate just came in. he is doing the laundry. i feel like he feels that he has a lot to do. it seems to me he likes to work. i am going to keep my life simple here at college. i won't expect myself to be a superhero. i think waking up for class is good because then the day doesn't go by. in college you have a lot of free-time. i think i spend too much time studying ineffectively. i should set good goals and then spend time making friends. i am very happy right now. i feel kind of just like sitting here and not getting up. i have to get up to get the trash. whenever i do work, i think of doing it in sequences. sometimes i act smart. it's okay--i like to make intellectual jokes a lot. my parents used to take the trash from my room when i was young. they did a lot of things for me. now i have to do a lot of things on my own. that's okay--we're almost out of milk. i'm going to get paper plates and paper cups so i can just throw them away after using it. i'm getting hungry. my roommate is eating spaghetti from downstairs. that tastes good. am i being artificial?  am i talking as if i want people to hear what exactly i'm saying. i don't now. bye     ",0
"man i wish i could go home, i really miss lee i know he is right down stairs but i wish he would come over. i can't wait until my sister comes today, we will have so much fun, oh i need to do my homework for math, and i can't forget to go to that meeting at 1:15. that reminds me of what i have to find out about it the subject i want to do. i wish sarah would wake up i can't believe she was out until 3:00 last night, that is really late, but i guess since she didn't have any classes it is not that big of a deal. i want to eat lunch, i'm really hungry, i need to pack to, i can't believe i have to pack to go down the street, that is so stupid, i need to call my mom and tell her to get nicci to bring that shoulder bag. for next weekend. i'm tired. i wish i were asleep like sarah. i wonder what our homework for linguistics is? i guess i need to look. this is a really weird thing to do, i wonder if i am doing it right, and what they will find out about me. i wonder if i am crazy, i don't think so though. i miss my mommy! i wish i was going home instead of staying here, but i guess that is ok. blaire is so stupid sometimes. i need to not forget my stuff in the dryer. i wish blaire and russ didn't fight all the time, i mean i love them both, but they are so annoying when they argue. oh yeah, i need to figure out where benihana's is so we don't get lost, i guess i can look on the internet. i love family feud, and playing it online, but it is hard, cause i always am talking to people and when i am trying to play that stinks. i'm glad kim and arianna are my friends, and i'm glad i'm in the fig, it was such a good idea. but i wish i didn't have to take english over again. i wish i could just be in the fig and have just math and psychology. i am so tired, i can't believe i had to get up for one class today, i should have just slept in, it is all cloudy and everything any way, why should i get up when it is so dreary outside. math is so easy; i don't have to go there to understand it. i could just get the homework assignment and i wouldn't need to listen to her talk. man this is really hard to think of things to write i feel like my mind isn't thinking. i wonder how much longer my stuff in the dryer has. i don't like having to write everything i think, oh yeah i need to call and see how many minutes my phone has on it, so i don't go over. that is a lot of money if i go over my time. i need to look up the phone number to find out how many i have. i wonder whom i call, the place i bought the phone or nokia, i don't know. i am thinking about thinking, i can't think any more. this is so weird. i wonder what lee is doing. i wonder if i am disturbing sarah's sleep, oh well she disturbs mine when i am trying to sleep all the time. man, i really am hungry now; i wish my 20 minutes would hurry up and get over with. i guess i am thinking about doing something else besides this. i am tired of typing. 20 minutes feels like along time when you type continuously. i wish i could think about something else. i can think about sleep, it is good. my bed is too hard though. i need to talk to my mom about that mattress store. i wonder if what russell said was true? i mean that is crazy if that really happened. i need to go to the store. i need to order nicci's bday cake. man i'm cold. that fan is really powerful. i wish lee would hurry up and pack so that we could go eat, i'm hungry, but i don't know what to eat, the cafeteria always stinks and the place down stairs is so stinking expensive. i wish that the deli thing would open it will be so good. i wonder what kind of bread they will have. my contacts are drying out from this fan, but luckily i don't have much time left to write. thank goodness. i hate typing all my thoughts for so long the time seems forever away. i wonder if i am using to many dining dollars, i need to go look and see. i need to pay my thing too. my face itches. ok it's better. i guess my time is almost up! yeah! i'm hungry i think i'm almost finished. i need to hurry up and eat though, because i have to get my clothes out of the dryer, so no one steals them. ok, i'm finished. i need to spell check it now. bye ",0
"this seems kind of odd to sit and write to a complete stranger. i wonder if i should try to be grammatically correct, if i should capitalize my letters. normally my mind is very poetic in it's way of thining. i can walk around daily thinking of poems, constantly creating poetry out of the world. then there's the side of me that is analytical, am i typing too much? why am i talking to myself? damn a minute is a long time? there are always questions. i've always had a fascination with animals, this in turn make me grow way too fond of my pets. i believe it's personally healthy for me, but it is controversial. . (no i do not do vulgar things with my dog). i have a weenie dog, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to me. i got her when i was really sad and it is her that lifts me up. the breed itself is funny, their length is their personality. it is also amusing that i, a man hating lesbian, have a weenie dog. my room is really hot right now, i'm here thinking of leaving, not sleeping; i already sleep too much. you would think it takes longer than five minutes to think this much but oh well. i feel like i'm talking to myself but it's odd to know that someone will read this. what happens if someone says they will kill themselves. do you shrug it off, or do you intervene? i think i would like a job were i just sit and read peoples thoughts, i think maybe 20 minutes might be too long but it's not a big deal. it's like i'm turning paranoid, i'm starting to think of things to write, like my outfit or my hands, almost like when your senses are on high and you have acute hearing and taste and smell and touch. that's when you are precise, you know what you are talking about. there is alot of dissapointment in the senses. our mind has such an imagination that we are often dissapointed by what it really feels like or something such as that. i also wonder what this expiriment is for. what is it that you are trying to get out of me? my age you know, my life you never will so what's up your cranium?  that's a funny thing to say. my mind is slowing down and i don't have that much to say. i don't really think i can do this continous thing.  is it ok if i pause a few times. it's weird the things people are worried about, like what could you possibly do to me if i said vulgar things to you on this assignment. i watched a good movie yesterday, it had a cheater in it, something i now can relate to. it's not good to feel that, never will be most likely (unless jealousy ignites your desires). i only wish i never do that to anyone, for i know how it feels and it is from that that i do not want to hurt people. but i know i might not be strong enough to substain. so i leave my door open to things, to everything and i wonder now that it's the end of my time wether or not it automatically cuts you off at 20 minutes or can you finish your sentence. i guess that is just a common worry, but if it's not maybe i'm just paranoid.

"i am thinking about why exactly i am writing this. i am thinking about how each of my fingers move to touch the keys. roseanne is on and it is starting to distract me. i really should pay attention to the writing but the sound of the people speaking is distracting me. the show is talking about feminism, which brings up an interesting point. i really don't like women who are amazingly feministic. i just forgot what my next thought was. oh well, i feel kinda of hungry. maybe i should get something to eat. but instead i have this laptop sitting on me while i try to type my steam of consciousness. speaking of stream of consciousness, which i spelled wrong above. the stream of consciousness is something that i read in the textbook. some doctor of psychology came up with this idea that monitoring the stream of consciousness will lead to people understanding more about themselves. roseanne just made a joke and it is funny. but as i was thinking or writing which ever one your prerogative chooses. before i digress, or maybe i will or maybe i won't. now that i choose to reflect on my day i realize that i didn't get that much accomplished, but there is still a lot of the day left. i am really not sure where i am going from here. there was just a commercial about the aggie came against utah. boy i sure do love hi i just answered my phone and it is kristi my friend she is also in psychology. we are talking about this assignment. she is walking back from the dobie center. i am supposed to meet her and her friend richard. i am going to play richard in football on the video game. boy i really like football. like i was saying i love football and i can't wait till the game against arkansas. boy that is sure going to be a good game. i just happened to notice that i only have six minutes left to write. i really like this assignment it is really fun. my hands are getting tired of typing and i just thought back to when professor said that someone put in instructions to a vcr that is definitely funny. i really don't like roseanne but somehow she is getting my attention. i am really trying to concentrate on what i am thinking but i believe that is the reason it is hard for me to write more, because i am thinking so hard. my computer fan just turned on and that means it is starting to get hot. but in here it is actually cool. speaking of my dorm room, i really like it. well my 20 minutes is up but i am just going to finish writing this last line right here.

"i have never been asked to do anything like this before. it is actually hard to think of anything to think about when you are asked to. this class seems as though it is going to be very interesting. many people act in strange ways. maybe this class will help me better understand that. i have a friend that acts in strange ways. well, actually he use to be my boyfriend. it is so intersting to sit back and watch how he reacts to different things. he sometimes is so hateful and so mean to people for no reason. he has said so many mean things to me and the next day he is sorry for acting the way he did. but the funny thing is, he always ends up doing it again. my dad is somewhat the same way. but he seems more like he has a split personality. it is sometimes very scary. he can just snap sometimes and be a totally different person then he really is. most of the time it is for no apparent reason. maybe him being a heavy drinker has something to do with it. i also have a friend that doesn't know how to deal with her emotions too well. she goes literally crazy sometimes. one time i didn't answer my cell phone, and she left the most hateful voice mail. if you would have heard it, you would have thought she was crazy too. but when i confront her about it, she says sorry and can't explain why she did it. i seem to always be stuck in the middle of everything. no matter who is involved or what the situation is, my name always some how pops up. it is pretty aggrivating actually. and i have always lived my life to my dads standards. i never really get to worry about pleasing myself, because i always have to worry about pleasing my dad. my dad wanted me to be a cheerleader. so of course i worked my butt off to become one. he also wanted me to get in to ut. don't get me wrong, i love it here. but the more i do want he wants the more he ask of me. none of his other children are asked to live up to his standards.

"my chemistry book does not have a periodic table in it while my roommate's physics book does. i find that somewhat strange, as the periodic table does not really have as much to do with physics as it does with chemistry. i have come to the realization that indian producer people truly are strange. this realization has come after a weekend of analyzing music videos and such. i mean, they parody off of old songs as well as songs from here and incorporate a million and one costume changes and odd moves into their dances. the people upstairs just made another random noise. it sounds like they are always moving furniture or wrestling or something. i'm pretty sure there are guys up there, since i don't think that girls move their furniture daily and wrestle. i really don't know what they do upstairs. the people next door to us are just as strange. they screen their phone calls i think; their phone is always ringing and no one picks up. but then i hear them in their room. actually, i'm beginning to think that screening phone calls is a pretty good idea. we've gotten some random phone calls. some of these calls came from people i know very well and yet i can't understand the messages they leave on the machine. i just realized that i have very random thoughts; i think that this means that i'm not really focused on what i'm doing or something. actually, i'm trying to think of something really meaningful to say in these twenty minutes and my mind is coming up quite blank. i just don't seem to be able to find an issue to get up on a soapbox about. that is quite sad; generally i always have something that i can just ramble on and on about for hours on end. yet when i'm called to do just thatnot a thing shows up. i wonder when i'm going to get rid of my cough. i refuse to take cough syrup because i don't like the taste of it, and so i'm going to be suffering with this cough for a while. i don't know why the cough syrup manufacturers can't add artificial flavors to the cough syrup to make it taste good. then again if they did that, kids would want to take it and then they would get addicted to it. that would most definitely not be a good thing. i guess even if it tastes bad enough people buy it; but making it taste better would be a good thing. at least, change the flavor from cherry to, say, grape. grape is a good flavor. chocolate is a good flavor too. i like chocolate. actually i like all sugar; i think my roommate would agree with me in saying that the sugar i intake daily is what causes my oddness. but sugar is good nevertheless. so is chocolate. i don't think it causes acne. how can something that tastes so good be so bad? of course the same comment could apply to other things as well (pizza, italian food, etc). ah well. i never knew twenty minutes could last so long. it's neverending. i feel like thirty minutes have gone by, but my watch tells me only fifteen. there was just another random thud from the people next door. i think they must have dropped something plastic. i just realized that i don't really know any of the people who live around me. i think that's probably because we have private baths and so we never really come across one another. that's kind of sad, considering i hear from everyone that """"people who live on the same floor as you become your family"""" and i don't really seem to sense that. we all pass each other by in the hall and on the elevator, but we never really take the time to speak to each other. that, to be honest, is the one thing i didn't like about ut. the fact that everyone knows people already makes it impossible, or at least very difficult, to make new friends. even when you make the effort, it's tough to meet new people. we all have our high school buddies. well my time is almost up for writing this assignment; just as well, my hand hurts from typing for twenty minutes straight. if i had counted the number of times i hit the backspace button during this exercise, i think i would come up with this huge number. i never knew i'm so bad at typing; i have the speed part down, but the accuracy eludes me yet.

"right now my mind is confused because i'm not sure what exactly i am suppose to be writing. i think the more i write, the more information flows into my mind. for example, write now i just thought about how sunburned i am, and i wonder if i am going to peal. i'm also thinking about what i'm going to do tonight. i'm so tired, but i don't want to miss a night out with my friends. seeing how i'm at my home in tyler, i feel that i should spend as much time as i can with the people i don't see everyday. it is my first time to come home from college and i'm begining to understand what say about it being so stressful. there is just so much to do and not nearly enough time to do it in. i constantly think of all the homework and reading i should be doing in all my spare moments, but it's just so hard to concentrate when there is so much to do. i just found out that ttexas won today. i'm mad i missed the game-i bet it was so exciting. i hope this whole thing doesn't sound too dumb, although i'm sure it does. i wonder what everyone else has written on this assignment. i'm not a very deep person, but i have a feeling that this class will help me learn some things about myself and what i do think about. there is so much going on in my head that it's hard to pick out every single thought. well, i just looked down and my time is up. hope this has been interesting to read!!

my thoughts are everywhere right now i am thinking about getting my computer fixed because it has a virus. i need to sleep that is the biggest change for me in college is the late nights and busy days i am used to busy days from high school but not the late nights. it is strange but interesting and fun being semi independent i have another late night tonight that i am not quite ready for but it is my pledge line for ka which will be another consumer of much of my time but it should be very fun once pledgeship is finshed i am looking forward to getting to meet and become close with my pledge brothers because being from a smaller town i don't know as many people as a lot of folks down here but i didn't want go to school with all my old high school friends  really because i wanted to meet new people i do miss my best friedn though he is somebody i could always talk to trip out with and just we knew what we are thinking without having to say anything it is strange not having a best friend down here right now and its tough because it takes lots of time and lots of escapades and wild nights bad times good times high school sports all those things made us great friends and now i have to try and make some more friends like that here in austin my roommate  just left and i am still trying to make my decision about that situation he is an alright guy but he is not really the type of person i see myself spending lots of time with but i am sure i will being roommates and joinin the same fraternity but i always look at it as it could be a lot lot worse. lost my train of thought sorry i'm having trouble focusing today i feel very out of it but i've got class in a while so i won't be able to take a nap i think i am getting sick and rundown hopefully i can shake this little congestion i have but with all the new stress in life these days i don't know how well that will work out i'm not feeling to great at all sometimes i wonder if ut is the right place for me and that is just a backand forth thought cause some days it is and some times when its a bad day i wish i was back home in my own bed with dog i miss her haha that sounds so cheesy haha but she is a good dog and she always will cheer you up i can hold a thought today it seems like i feel like i am being random but some how i feel like i keep saying the same things i am not looking forward to walking to class i don't like that very much and i get to search for the computer shop to drop my laptop off to get this virus taken care of that is a pain i feel like i havent met enough people yet i want to be more outgoing but i am naturally more of a quiet person i enjoy listening and watching other peoples behaviors and stuff i like to feel people out and get a sense of who they are before i just start relaxing around them i try to be assertive and approachable and outgoing but that doesn't always go so well and people take my quietness in the wrong way it is often seen as me being stuck up angry rude and that drives me crazy but all i can do is be who i am        ,0
"i'm not so sure how i felt about it yet. not that it was bad or anything, but i'm just not sure how the questions asked could lead to a better understanding of an individual. it seemed to me that questions that were asked only dealt with a couple of issues. mostly gender, weight, and scared issues. but than again, i guess the experiments that i did this for will probably deal with those issues. i really don't know why i tried to do that survey right when i got up this morning, i just about fell asleep on the keyboard, but that's alright, i finally got through it. after it frizzed up on me 4 times. that was a little frustrating. there is something else that's really bothering me right now also. nothing to do with school, but socially. i live in california, and hate to say it, but i am a pretty stereotypical californian kid. i mention this because i have this burning passion for the ocean. even most people who live in california don't feel as deeply about it as i do. i knew it was going to be hard to leave the ocean when i came to school, but i didn't want to shut myself off from new opportunities and experiences by staying close to the water. well anyway, i really miss the ocean. every night i try to picture the crashing waves, and feel the cool mist on an earl morning. when i walk to class i even feel it in my feet and legs. just on their own my legs begin to surf. the same muscle motions, i guess they call it muscle memory. i can feel myself cutting up the face of a racing wave and slashing the hell out of the lip. or just grabbing the rail of my board on a meaty left, stalling, and hear the swirl of the water and air in the tube. that's all i live for. or lived for. texas seems to have stopped my love for a little while. no i take that back, nothing can stop my love for it, i guess texas just got in the way for a little while. that's where my problem comes up socially. i now realize that if you're not in california, or any beach community for that matter, people just don't understand. i feel like people just view me as some tan kid that dresses a little funny, and claims he does this thing called surfing. like i said, the perfect stereotype. i guess i wouldn't mind being a poster boy, if kids just knew how i felt. how the ocean just pulls you in, and won't let go. it's a way of life, not just a social activity. it's a culture, and it's become who i am. not just surfing. i love it but that is only one small facet of why i love the ocean. i just fall asleep every night dreaming of all the good times i've had there. whether it be piling into one of my friends cars at 600 in the morning for a dawn patrol session without anybody else in the water. skateboarding down the boardwalk, trying to race the waves as they peel away. just sitting on the sand with my good friends, talking about anything and everything at the same time. or going there alone, at night to just erase all the thoughts and bad things that happened that day, week, month , or even year. the ocean can do all of that. but people don't seem to realize that. i love texas, well i don't know if i love texas. but i definitely love ut, it's just that i have to sacrifice so much more that i realized that i would have to do. i came here and had to leave the biggest, most passionate part of me back home. that's hard for anyone to do regardless of what it might be. it's not that i feel like i'm viewed as an outsider here. more of a novelty, or attraction actually. but i just wish people would have the same opportunities as i did, or have. i want them to fall in love as i did. but that's impossible if you stay in texas for a lifetime. come to think of it, i really haven't even talked to many of my friends from back home, i think i'm going to do that today. i've been so focused on making a home for myself here, that i lost sight of the one back in sd. i'm going to make a promise to myself that i will never lose touch of what i left back home, or the people that i left. just tuck them away as memories, fond memories as i continue to grow, and add to those memories here.

"this assignment should be interesting but at the same time inhibited my slow typing. i do not like to use computers especially the internet. i had such problems on the internet when i was applying to ut that i almost did not get in because of them. but i am here now and happy. the one thing i am surprised about at ut is that there aren't more blacks or persons of color. i guess that is just the way things go. there are a lot of other ethnicities represented here though. my high school graduating class of 100 had 6 minorities in it. ut is a bit of a change. but for the better i am sure. my high school on houston was private and some would venture to say snobby. i agree but a lot of times it was nice being in a homogeneous world. it reminds me of our country club in houston. 1000 memberonly wasp. it is really not all that bad, though from a member's perspective. i like being one in a big heard of the same type of people. that is why i joined a fraternity up here at ut. it is fun and a good way to meet girls and guysmostly whom are white. i totally understand, value, and enjoy the perspectives of minorities though. last year in a history discussion class there was a hispanic girl and she brought so many unique and amazing perspectives to the table although most of them had to do with religious based ideas. speaking of religion i need to get some while i am up here in college. nobody has enough time for religions up here it seems but wouldn't that be so much better if they did. i find religion to be the best thing on the face of the earth although i do not get or have enough. the problem is it is difficult to do so and the results are not as immediate as a good grade on a test or anything else you work hard for. i miss my home church but i will probably end up going back there. i probably will end up moving back to houston when all of my schooling is done. just like my dad and his dad's dad. i am a 7th generation harris county resident and that makes me happy. i wonder how many times i have used the word 'i' in this writing. how many minutes have i written for only five to go. i might be a slow typist. never could type to well. not good hand eye coordination. my brother has good hi coordination. my wisdom teeth hurt and i need to get them removed or just take some more advil. speaking of advil and the thing that i thought i would be using them the most for, hangovers, i don't even drink half as much up here at school as i did back in high school. maybe that is a good thing. 2 more minutes. my hands are a bit sore. what to write or think about. today was a good day i hope that that girl i met at dinner tonight has an interest in me and not my friend michael. she said she liked michael. he has a girl friend though who is coming to town soon. i bet she is good looking ",1
"i wonder if he is thinking of me????  i am glad i am finally getting this done cause there is no need for procrastination now. i need to do all this as soon as i get it. i had done this before but i could not submit it. i have something special with alex and i know how he feels and he is different. he isn't like all other guys he is innocent and pure and he would not hurt me. i hope not to hurt him. i need him and need someone like that. someone to take care of me and to be there for me if i need to  talk someone to talk to me and someone that i can take care of and love too. he is perfect in my eyes and although he might not know that he is he is wonderful. he will never know i guess. he is there for me when i most needed him. he has held me when i cried and has made me laugh when i was sad'  i owe a lot to him. we have spent a lot of time together and it has been really fun. i wonder if he knows how much fun i have had with him. i don't think he understands. i am going through a hard time and i am going through a big transition, but i think i am doing fairly well. i have not cried much. my roommate went home this weekend and i felt kind of lonely cause we are used to going places together and it felt weird to  come home and be alone and not have someone to talk to or even argue with. we had gotten into an argument before this weekend and the time that we were apart really helped us understand each other. we are okay now. my exboyfriend has given me a hard time too. i don't want to be with him anymore, yet he still persists. he know that i am dating alex and that it is over between us yet he still calls and he still asks questions like where were you and who were you with. i want to get away from that i am tired of having to answer questions about my own life. i want to be free and to be able to do what i want and that i think is right not what other people think i should do. it isn't fair to me  if i have to make someone else happy before i could do things for my own freedom. it important to be free because without freedom a person is not happy or simply can't be an individual. there are many things to do here in austin and many many people to meet and make friends with. i have had a good time so far and i have enjoyed going to class and learning. although i do think that i should read a little more. i will be fine though. claudia and alex will be there if i need anything.

"well, lets see . . . i guess the foremost thing i have on my mind is moderate confusion about what exactly i'm supposed to be writing about. i guess that doubt and lack of confidence about what i'm suppose to be doing is a part of my thoughts and what not and thus is appropriate to write about. hehe, now i feel confident and more sure of this whole writing assignment. wow, how quickly my entire psychological outlook can turn 180 degrees. what else?  im not hungry or anything, not really tired tomorrow. im a little worried about whether im going to be awake enough to pay attention in my 8 o'clock class tomorrow. i'm also a little preoccupied by something someone said to me today, labeling me as too quite and inaggressive in committing myself to just about everything. i guess they might be right, i am a little hesistant to get involved in anything i think might not work out or turn out as i expect. i was thinking about rushing for a couple of frats, but then i realized i didnt even know what they were about. i was caught up in the promise of brotherhood and having fun and being a part of something special, but then i realized i didnt know what i was getting in to and that i might not be able to get out if i changed my mind. thus, i decided not to rush, perhaps because of the fear of commitment and unfulfilled expectations that someone stated dictates most of my actions, or perhaps because i had a valid thought in suspecting i really don't know much about what precisely the fraternity actually did or stood for, who knows?  what else am i thinkin about?  how about how much longer im suppose to be writing for. i've been writing nine minutes and i havent really noticed. this assignment isnt as bad as i thought it would be and is actually kind of nice. almost like a diary of my thoughts; definately good for venting. man, i sure hope this is what i'm suppose to be doing. i hope i didnt entirely miss the purpose of this assignment and not ger credit. i mean, im writing about my thoughts and stuff, which seems to deal with psychology and the human mind, so i think im doing good here, but im really not sure. man, i'm getting a little behind in my reading. a lot of the lectures in many of my classes seem to cover the text exactly so im a little unmotivated to read. i know i should and i know there is some extra information in the book, but really im just lazy or something. to be honest, im unsure of what i need to do to succeed in college. i've yet to take a test or quiz so i don't really know what the deal is. i know it is suppose to be harder than high school, or so many people tell me, but then again some people tell me its about the same as high school but with more reading. i don't know . . . . i know i should prolly be more focused on my studies but im really cocky when it comes to academics. i know the university of texas is a fine school with many intelligent students, but i still feel im more capable than just about every one of them. i guess its part cockiness and part confidence. i don't think my attitude about the matter will be altered until i take my first test and totally mess it up. but if i just coast and do fine on the test, ill keep on coasting. i mean, i pay pretty good attention in my classes and remember a lot, so i think i'll be okay. ouch, someone just snuck up on me and smacked me. can't they see im trying to do my assignment?  how inconsiderate. i guess i would probably do the same. notbody wants to hear that someone else is busy studying and doesn't have time to do anything even though all of us at some time or another must do the same and decline some invitation to some undoubtedly riveting event or activity in order to tend to less exhilirating, more educational ventures. hey, only one minute left . . . maybe not, hehe, maybe i can still have some fun. man, this writing assignment was tyte. it flew by in no time. actually, i think i feel better now then i did before i started. how cool, if anyone ever read this, these writing assignments rock!

"     i was thinking about college and all the stuff that comes with it. college will be so hard yet so easy, i wonder how i will control myself. i don't want the fun factor to totally overrule the work factor. but then again, the classes seem pretty fun and not so hard. yet again, it has also only been a week of classes, so i could be sorely mistaken. we will just have to see what happens as time unfolds. i'm also a little worried because i have a boyfriend that goes to stephen f. austin state university, and driving distance that is 3 and 1'2 hours away!! how will i manage this?? we have been together for over a year and a half, so i can't just throw the relationship away, he means a lot to me. what do i do?? i guess i will give it time and see what happens. college is a lot to handle, and managing it all with a long-distance boyfriend is not easy. i don't know what i'm getting myself into. i'm also really pissed that i decided to stay at dobie, because after visiting friends in towers today i realized how much better it is, and what i rip off dobie is. the food sucks!! it drives me insane how bad it is and what a rip off everything is. towers is way better. i'm just glad that i'm rooming with my great friend shara in a badass apartment next year. yay!! we'll have our own rooms and all we'll have to do is take a short bus trip to campus every day. not that bad. plus we'll be more familiar with campus and won't get so lost, as i do here constantly. but it is my first year after all, so it can't be that bad. i'm also kind of nervous about my freshman seminar class, it sounds so ridiculously hard! a lot of writing and sharing your   feelings,   and all that stuff. i had to read like 15 pages just on how to   listen   correctly to other people. i'm 18 years old! i know how to listen! this is not kindergarten. it just makes me so mad. i'm really glad i met my friend shara, i knew her slightly my senior year in high school so we come from the same background and have a lot to relate to. i've gotten to know her so well these past 2 weeks that i feel like i've known her all my life! she's such a great girl. i like how she does not hesitate to compliment her friends for anything. great character trait to have. and i'm glad about all the parties that are here in austin, and the unique culture. walking around even with a friend at night is a little scary though, but i'll never walk by myself anyway so it's all good. and i love the music scene. i'm afraid i'll go too shopping-crazy though because urban outfitters is so readily available down the street and back home in houston it was like miles away towards downtown. i'm obsessed with spongebob! i have three spongebob squarepants posters on my wall in my dorm room, and i have spongebob band-aids. he's so cute! and the show is hilarious, totally my type of humor. i have the dvd as well, is that scary or what?? and you know what makes me mad? i got a heat rash here a few days after i moved in! that sucks! why here of all places? i think houston is much hotter just because of the huge humidity factor. but no i get a heat rash here. sucks. at least it's not visible, it's only little bumps you can barely feel. and i got a popped blood vessel in my eye. what more could possibly go wrong? i guess a lot but it's so much to handle right when i get there! makes me so self conscious! i guess that's a psychology topic--why people get self-conscious. interesting topic. i would like to talk about it sometime in class. i think when i'm done with this i will do some physics problems and then just watch zoolander on dvd or something. yay. i'm so glad i have a tv, vcr, and dvd player! my room is totally pimped out, how great is that. i feel so exhausted. walking isn't easy in this heat, no matter what time of the day it is. i'm actually getting really hungry. i might fix myself a peanut butter sandwich. crunchy, but of course, what else? crunchy is the way to go. should i feel guilty about making plans to go to a party on a thursday night? is that bad? i don't really think so, seeing as on fridays i have only one 1 hour class from 12-1. wow that was a lot of 1s. god i'm so hungry, is this thing over yet? my hands are shaking. need food. aagh. peanut. butter. crunchy. does it matter if i'm coherent or not? it's just that when i get hungry, wham it hits me like a train and i get all hungry and can't help it. oh well. i hope this thing was entertaining for you, or whoever is reading this thing. i'm glad i got this over with early. yay im done.

"     so, it's a tuesday night, and there's nothing to do. i ate dinner earlier and can   feel the food digesting. i am rather anxious about something. not terribly that it is   distracting, but i feel as though i am expecting something. it might be that i am   nervous about school. it's a new place for me, coming from minnesota. i haven't   really made my close group of friends. sure, i've been having loads of fun, but i   still don't have that complete feeling of acceptance yet. i haven't found my niche.   it's almost like i am waiting for it to be a month from now when i've found my place.   it's also hard in class, becuase i don't know many, hardly any at all, people in   them. i don't have people where i can go to work on projects or anything. this   makes me a little worried about how i am going to do, becuase i can't compare   answers on homework with friends, and i can't discuss new concepts with anyone.   i think that the move to a toally new placed this past month has been a little more   stressful than i originally expected. but i am not worried because there are so   many people here that i know it can't be too long before i find my place. austin is a   great city also. that's a definite plus. the city has just a great atmosphere. i've   seen two concerts here and i love it. i can't wait to see even more of the city and   it's cool places. music is a big part of my life and i think that is really going to make   me happy. it's great to know that just about every week there will be a concert or   something i will love to do. i am really excited to get to know some of the local   musicians. that'll be cool. i also have feelings that i want to have a girlfriend. i don't really know what i want   sexually. i feel like i want a steady girlfriend. someone who i can always be close   with. i really think that will help make my transition into texas easier. but it's hard   for me to find someone who i'll get along with this well. another thing i think about   is committment. i dont' know if i want a long term relationship. also, would it be to   distracting for be because of school?  i certainly know that school is my priority, but   now that i'm in college, i have to discover how much time i really need to spend   doing work to maintain my gpa. i think that the first semester is the hardest   because it's a new atmosphere and i have to test the limits and such.   another thing that kind of worries me is my suitemate. he is a big partier, and   although i like to party some, he's always up very late at night and is usually very   loud. it's hard for me to tell whether it will last or if it's just the first week of school   and he's really excited. i just hope that he will get to studying. i am sur that all will   work out. i really feel that things usually do work out, and eventually i will feel   hapiness and the anxious feeling will go away. i'm just anxious to not be anxious   anymore.

"     i cannot wait to go and see emily this weekend. nanny is coming into town; i love that woman. she is a great person, an amazing person. it has been awhile since i have seen her. i wouldn't mind not going to the ou game. it would be so nice to have this place to myself without anyone else ere for a weekend. even if there ws nothing to do. i could catch up on  reading and homework or get ahead. but then again lne said that most people would die to go to the ou game and that i should accept the offers i receive. i rejected the first. the second one is someone who i just met last night. and i want to attend the game and this is the best way because tickets are so hard to get. but i have to stay in a hotel room with this guy. i guess i will just say i have a boyfriend. speaking of. i like chad. he is very nice looking, very polite. he did everything right. i wonder if he likes me? i wonder if he will call today. only time will tell. i hate michael for what he did to me. no i hate what he did, i don't hate him. i don't hate anybody. jenny and emily have become two of my best friends. i talk to each of them several times a day. the weird thing is, they have been friends for 7 years. and now, over some guy, emily hates jenny. emily has done the same thing to me that jenny has done to emily. i do not really feel sorry for her. it feels weird that although they do not speak to each other, i speak to each of them many times each day and usually the other is not mentioned, and i dare not bring up the other, i do not want to stir things up or be in the middle of it. so i am going to see jeff this weekend when i visit emily. i know he will want me to stay the night with him. but so will emily. i wonder if she would care. i don't want to do anything with him. it is just hard to put out old flames. we cannot start anything again. i just got a computer a few days ago and now it is not working! i am taking it home tonight to have someone work on it. sam is always in our dorm room. last night everyone and their dog were in my dorm. i have 8 am class mon through thursday. i could not get to sleep until 2am. then i turned off the two larms i set and my neighbor called tomake sure i was up at around 7:40. yikes. i hopped out of bed, brushed my teeth and ran out of my room. i want to see a movie. that is what i feel like doing today. right now. maybe a nice sappy movie with lots of sweet romance-not corny though. or a thriller or scary movie. but i only like to see that with a guy. hmm. or one with vin diesel. now vin is definitely not usually my type, but after seeing fast and the furious and xxx, he definitely does it for me. he has such a sexy voive and attitude. usually i do not like guys that built. i need someone more my size. he is the exception. all 18 year old boys are assholes. i have not founf the exception to that rule. i will not even give one the time of day or a chance. i don't have time for that. but i think chad has already been through his stage. i think this one is worse than the terrible two's. i need to call holly. but i am afraid to tell her something i did with michael. i do not want her to pray for me or look down upon me. no she won't look down for me, but her heart will heart for me. but i am not really in the wrong direction. i pray. i know what is right and wrong. but no one is perfect. i also need to call my sister-i wonder how chad and kaycee are doing. those kids are absolutely rotten. i hope they grow out of it. it is just that they are beautiful and kaycee is so cute that nobody ever can remain angry with her. i hope that they are beautiful in high school and i know they will be-not just because they are my nephew and neice, their mother is beautiful. but i hope that they are not the snobby kids. or the rude kids. i hope they are humble and compassionate. high school kids do too much damage to other high school kids. it's awful. i wish that highschoolers could lern to look at things on the grand scale. i wish they could think more term and not so much about the situation. realize that it doesn't matter in callege. no one knows nything about you. it is a new start.

"right now, i am sitting here sick to my stomach and the world feels so small. i am waiting for a phone call that is so important, and if i don't get it, i am going to feel like a really big loser. yes, i did just get all the blessings i could ever ask for, so i am selfish to be wanting more, but its something i really really want. all i want is to make my parents proud and to give my family something they can brag about. i have spent my whole life wanting to achieve the best, and i get so sick when i let myself down. rejection sucks. its so hot in here, and as all my friends call because they just got the call,"""" i feel like a loser. i am proud of myself- but rejection is not something i handle well? what if the call does not come-- will i cry, will i blame my inabilities on something else, how will i react? the anxiety i feel right now is extreme. on top of all that, i am homesick. i have a great life here in austin, but since my family is a huge part of my life, i feel kind of left out being so far away. everything back home seems to go on without me. my roommate here is annoying and the tv here is always on. she follows me around and sometimes i feel used because she really does not know people here. she is not in a sorority and so sometimes i feel as if she is angry at me for that. i am so anxious. my boyfriend is supportive too, but i wonder sometimes if he really has deep feelings for me. yes, i know about his fear of commitment and all that crap, but we have been together for way too long for me not to feel totally secure with him. oh, that stupid seventh heaven song. turn off the dang tv. all i want is peace and quiet without all the noise. oh, and i have to worry about yesterday too. my sorority is awesome, but it makes me really uncomfortable to drink around some of them. yes, i know. its silly if we all drink together. but, sometimes i feel as if i have this image that i have to uphold. and that image reflects back onto all aspects of my life. my family, my faith, my school, my friends. how do i act? how do i dress? who do i associate myself with? all of these things constantly flood my brain, and sometimes all i want to do is get far away from those thoughts. do people love me for me? do they love me for who i am here or the grades i make or the house i live in or the money my parents make? how do people view me? and that tv, always on. what i would give for that chatter to stop for 10 minutes. i can't even study with the noise. i am worried about this year. i need a job, i have bills to pay, i am in hard classes. how will i measure up? i love my life, i love my life. but i could seriously do without the stress. i am determined, and i already have accomplished so much this semester, but will it end? i want it to stay this way, but there is so much to lose. i am scared that i will lose it. how do i not lose it? i pray all the time, and i count my blessings. its hot in my apartment and it smells like paint. why did i choose to live in an apartment with a girl i don't like? what possessed me to do this? did i feel independent and like a big girl? now i feel young and naive, and way out of my league. oh, the insanity, but good things come to those who wait and i put all my trust into a higher being so things will work out.

"good morning. eventhough it's 12:30pm that is still morning in college hours. they say you need a minimum of 8hours at my age, but i feel ten is a little more at par. i'm trying to wake up so the music of the late elliott smith, a quiet honest indie-rock musician but my roommates won't turn down the overwhleming bass of whatever it is they're listening to. it's kind of frusterating but after it's all dried up, i don't think i could have got  better roommates. i love sitting at my laptop when i wake up like this with the curtains open letting the austin sun flood in like a warm bath. our apartment is a hellhole after weekends of careless partying. it's absurd really. so monday night i found out from some of my friends in college station that my girlfriend, or x-girlfriend, has already been cheating on me there. damn aggies. can't live with them, can't kill them. it's a cruel world. but i'll be better off without her i think. i talk to my brother about the experience, the unforgettable feeling of a broken heart. where everythought of the person, especially with someone else, makes you want to vomit. but you still want to kiss them, even though they just kissed you with a boot to the face. but i suppose it's like morgan freeman says in the movie seven, """"love costs, it takes effort. """" that's true. back to my brother, he has been through this experience more times than anyone person deserves. he told me the trick is to realize that you are better off, in most cases. for instance alyssa, my x, was beautiful no doubt. god she was gorgeous, which always made me wonder what she saw in a low-down dead-beat like your author. but she has no conscious knowledge of art. ignorance isn't the problem, she just doesn't care about things beyond looks, impression and money. and well obviously she doesn't know what """"love"""" really is. but then again maybe i don't either. but i know i loved her, i believed her lies. i bought the  false love she was selling for cheap. i still love her i suppose, i can't deny it. but she loved herself, before she loved me. and now i have to do the same. i have to be strong and let time heal all. another thing  my brother said was how she didn't have that one thing. like i was talking about her lack of care for art, and the beautiful small idiosyncracies of life. she had beauty, she had the ability to kill me with her eyes and her smile, but she lacked that one thing. and i quote ben harper, """"so many people to love in my life, why do i worry about one?"""" i know there are better people out there so. and i have to be the nicest cheated on boyfriend ever. i honestly felt bad after i chewed her out and she was crying. try and figure that one out. i suppose i'm just the nice guy that they say finishes last. but i don't believe that saying. nice guys don't finish last, they just get shit on until they get the best in the end. i believe that if you hold out, if you stand true to yourself while still remain vulnerable to the love others have to offer, you will find them. i'm glad i don't have class today, makes it much easier to relax, despite the fact how much i enjoy college compared to high school. high school, what a joke. you are not pushed, you are not inspired. in high school, you are simply encouraged to be another sheep in the herd. to conform and be normal. i always saw high school as a factory for the confused and dilusionary youth of our country. but then again i am just one person. so i try to go out there, find small things to make me happy, if only temporarily to just get by. i guess that's my motive for life, for living happily and in peace. i try to never get out a high horse of beliefs or opinions. i think sometimes it's good to be apathetic and passive, and other times it is not. for instance, your friend wants to smoke a cigarette in your car. just relax and roll down the windows and cruise. but if your friend refuses to vote when he is done with that cigarette, that is unacceptable. it's sad when people don't care important issues. i guess i just think too many people care too much about insignifigant issues, when the yard needs to be mowed or who won american idol, and too little about the major issues, war, politics, etc. i think life is a crazy thing. a conitinuous expanse of consciousness and action. i think that maybe one day, i'll have all the answer, and then i will die. maybe  one day i will find a love that is true. maybe. maybe i think too much.

"my mind is clustered with the nonstop clicking of my roommate's mouse on her computer. it just keeps going and going and going. then comes the sound of my keyboard keys clicking away. and the sound of my next door neighbor's toilet flushing. i have the sudden urge to tell all the noises to just shut up. i hear the sound of my roommate coughing, and it reminds me of my grandfather, who passed away a few years ago. he died of pneumonia while in a coughing fit. now i'm thinking about lunch. which i was supposed to have an hour ago. yet, it is very upsetting because i have no food in the dorm in which i want to eat and the food at the dorms are not quite edible or appetizing. i'm thinking about my boyfriend, and how he'll come visit austin from houston this friday. he'll be coming here to have dinner with me and my roommates at a fancy restaurant. that will be quite exciting considering that i haven't had any great food in a long time. i'm really excited to see him because he lives back at home, where i moved from. this weekend i'll be going to see my parents. when i think of my parents, i get a guilty feeling because i know i haven't been very truthful to them. but, there are just things that i can't tell them because of the generation gap and everything else that occurs between parents and their kids. it makes me feel even guiltier that they miss me and want me to come home, but yet, i don't really miss them yet because i feel restricted in their presence. the sound of water running is making me want to take a shower because it just reminds me of showers. maybe because i just took a shower. my body feels warm and clean. i love that feeling. the sound of food is calling. but i need to type for another 15 minutes. for some reason. the little eraser shavings on my desk made me think of little insects and bugs. the thought isn't very pleasing considering the fact that i have an extreme hatred for insects. the thought of them makes me itch. now my eyelids feel heavier and heavier. writing continuously makes me tired. speaking of sleepiness, i think of the experiment we did on monday with the correlation between sleepiness and stress. i was one of the control group people who just sat there. sitting there listening to all the number counting was like a lullaby. i fell asleep soon after that. then i woke up to the sound of laughter, and realized that i left a big wet spot on my shirt sleeve because i had fell asleep with my wet hair on my sleeve. it wasn't a great picture because the people walking by might have thought that i drooled all over myself. not a good image. speaking of image, i went to rush for a business fraternity yesterday. it felt weird approaching everyone and trying to meet everyone. usually i am a more inward person and not likely to just go up to people and """"mingle,"""" but yesterday i needed to because it was a """"rush"""" event. i am thinking that both this fraternity might make me feel more comfortable with meeting people and approaching them, but at the same time. it might not be something i really want to do because i'm not the extremely social type. however, as for now, i will keep on rushing to see how things go. it makes me nervous about joining this fraternity because i know my boyfriend back home will feel somewhat against me hanging around a group of people he doesn't know. it already makes him nervous enough to know that i'm up here at the populated university of austin, and he's down there back home, in a known environment. so, there are many things to consider about joining these organizations. but like everyone's advice to me: don't get held down by some longdistance relationship when you get to college. maybe this is why they gave me the advice. because every time i go to some party or meet new people, i feel guilty that my boyfriend is not part of it with me. i suppose i get this feeling because he has always been there with me to meet everyone back home. now that we're in different environments, that is not possible anymore. however, i am still determined to make this relationship work. now i am really in the mood to go home, and really in the mood to walk up to my refrigerator for some food. one more minute to go. i see einstein on my computer screen. he makes me want to do well in school. i hope i will do well this year. i feel kind of nervous because there are so many more distractions here, but i suppose i'll learn to handle it.

"*****why does this keep going to the left instead of down a space at the end of each line prof. pennebaker?????************* as i sit in this library, i can't help but notice the pleasure i get from the quietness. it is the same feeling i get from sitting in a park or on a golfcourse. perhaps even in a bookstore. the quietness provides my mind with an escape from the everyday world of horns, traffic jams, and yelling. from this feeling, my mind seems to work on a smoother track, with less obstacles to overcome before i can finish a complete thought. if the world was in a complete silence at all times, or perhaps even if i were deaf, i believe i would be wiser and would be able to formulate thoughts easier. does this mean that deaf people actually have an easier time getting by in the world? or is their inability to communicate too much of a burden. maybe this is what's wrong with today's world. communication lines are so mixed up due to language barriers and different types of slang that the world is like one large deaf fishbowl. in that case, deaf people would have an easier everyday life because they would be minus the struggles we all go through with communication. if communication were an easy things, and we all saw eye-to-eye on all issues, achieving things such as world peace, business agreements, and compromises would be no big deal. where did the communication lines go wrong? why did humanity branch out into hundreds of different languages and tongues when one universal language could have eliminated so many problems. the answer to that will most likely never be found. this girl sitting to my right is awfully attractive, but i can't muscle up the courage to talk to her. is it once again the problem of communication, or does this have to do purely with a lack of courage. i would like to think it is a communication problem, but that would probably be just a lame excuse for not talking to her. of course it is a lack of courage. although i know she won't bite my head off, slap me, ignore me, or flat out dis me, i still am too much of a coward to begin a conversation with her. what if she knew what i was thinking right now. would she be flattered, embarrassed, insulted, or just flat out shocked? i guess i'll never know, unless i ask her. we both know that isn't going to happen because we've already established that i'm acting like a coward right now. no big deal, there are plenty of fish in the sea. wow! i can't believe how fast twenty minutes just went. writing without structure is a lot more enjoyable then writing with it, and as they say: time flies when you're having fun!

"i often wonder why i put so much effort into such trivial things such as looks because that can only do so far. i'm not happy with myself a lot and i run from my problems and it seems co dependence is necessity for me. college has been a wake up call and a sobering realization of how small we are. nelson mandella wrote in a speech something along the lines of """"we as humans are not afraid that we can't shine but we are afraid the of the things that we can do. any i feel like the catcher in the rye writing like this . it's so random my girl sent me a tape of songs to remember her by and they are supposed to sooth but instead they keep me up because i have such vivid memories of her. i worry about not being successful and being surpassed by my friends and that they will forget about me. i moved to texas in the middle of the summer and i was so depressed and i would look at myself and i hated the state of mind i was in and the negativity i was supporting and it was a ridiculous waste of time. i vow to make the place i'm at the best place. i bitch about so many things that are so trivial. there was an airplane crash the other day and everyone died . i can't help but think about how bad it is for those families and friends and here i was missing mine but they are certainly not dead. the people who have been directly affected by it are immersed in some tough times, and for me life is good. it's crazy how things work like that. i tried keeping a journal ,but i can't keep up with it very well so far, i can't wait to play lacrosse ,it has become such a big part of my life. every morning i wake always wishing i could sleep , but at night i always stay up, i wonder if a good philosophy to live life by is to say live everyday like the next day you going to get hit by a bus. it interests  me to talk to my parents and older adults to ask what they would have done differently if they could go back because it makes you realize how fast life goes by. my dad was so smart and i feel so much pressure to live up to him but he would kill me if he knew some of the things i've done, sometimes i feel ashamed but on the other end it is learning from mistakes. well this was interesting , i can't wait till the weekend, till christmas and till tuesday when lacrosse starts.

"9 on the west campus bus- please let me know if this will be a problem with the requirements of the assignment.  so what is this supposed to tell you?  are all of my little freudian hang-ups going to show themselves in my """"stream of consciousness"""" writing?  """"there are no right or wrong answers""""?  fine. i am constantly amazed by the blank looks on other peoples' faces when i pass them on the street or sit next to them on the bus-- are they really that dumb or do they just do an excellent job of faking it?  i sound like a big asshole, i know, but really, watching other people is my thing. lately, i guess they've just been frustrating me. i try to pick at least one person everyday and try to figure out as much as i can just by watching them. i'm probably way off base, and i don't presume to know everything about everyone just because i spend a while watching them scratch their heads and play with their hair on the bus never mind, i'm sick of this line of thought. i like to draw i play the clarinet and the piano i have a boyfriend named zach and a dog named simon-- sometimes they're similar  i wonder how flammable my dorm room is. i wonder how long it would take the chicks on my hall to realize someone is barbecuing in their room. the frat boys are having a shindig of some sort outside my room and i wonder what the significance of the word woo is- they say it all the time. i used to think i was an alien and sometimes that comes back to me i used to think a lot of things because i had way too active an imagination when i was a kid-- this is something no one should combine with drug use and i figured that out pretty quick sometimes zach really annoys the shit out of me-- if i'm an alien, so is he- just another galaxy he thinks i'm a bad driver and this just makes me want to cross big lanes of traffic and slam into a concrete wall just to prove what a bad driver really is. i also remember too much i don't like my fingernails much i wish i could play the guitar  i also wish i could make a perfect clay figure of my head so i'd know what it looks like to talk to me has it been twenty minutes? no. i'm looking at a screen full of garbage- how am i ever going to write a manifesto that will capture the imagination of the world and rocket me into super powerdom. if that's even a word. i do want to rule the world- a lot of people say that, but i really mean it my goal is to achieve greatness the only problem is that i have no idea how to even begin or what greatness even means to me i want to subsist on pomegranates entirely i have a really good relationship with my brother- he's really cool i had a dream that i could fly like a beetle i bet you don't even read this, do you?  so i could say that i want to kill the president or burn down the tower and it would go unnoticed?  i think the tower should be coated in vaseline.

"     right now i am sitting in my room at my apartment on 1000 w. 25th street. the apartments are called the chelsea, and i live with two other people in the apartment number 208. i have been stressing all day about when i was going to find the time to do my psychology writing assignment. i honestly feel like i have not had time in the past 6 days to even sit down for twenty minutes just to type out a stream of my thoughts. this is a pretty neat assignment. i am thinking about how i missed my metals class last thursday from eight o'clock in the morning until noon. since i missed the lab, i have to go in this friday from like eleven until my two o'clock government section. right now i am so tired i can hardly even think about my day on friday. i am also thinking about what i am going to do tonight. i wasn't really planning on going out, but one of my friends in my government class today asked me if i was going to go with her, so i ended up having to go because i would have felt bad saying no to her. what about the pre-testing i am going to do after this writing assignment?  i hope it is not hard because i think my brain will just about break down. i really like psychology. i was talking to my dad about it on the phone yesterday, and i was asking him how i wondered why i never took a psychology class before. my high school offered psychology classes, i just never thought to take them. i took sociology instead, and i actually didn't even like it very much which is weird because i ended up taking it once again before psychology in college. i was actually thinking about my schedule for next semester. it is crazy, but i am actually already stressed about things for next year, like where i'm going to live, what classes i am going to take, make sure i live somewhere close to a bus stop. my bedroom is up the stairs in my apartment, it is pretty cool because me and one of my best friends live upstairs, and my other best friend lives downstairs. it is so cool because we have a great location, i mean, we are close to anything there is fun to do on west campus. we can walk almost to any fraternity party, and to other of our friends' apartments who live around us. i ride the bus to class everyday, even though i could walk if i wanted too, but of course i don't. plus, all of my classes are at the art building, and the west campus bus takes you directly from almost the front of my apartment complex to the front doors of the art building. three out of four of my classes are in the art building. it is kind of weird because only two of my classes actually involve art. two dimensional design and beginning metals i. my government class is also in the art building, and i think it is because that is one of the few buildings on campus with an auditorium in it. i get really sick of being in the art building, even though i run into the same people almost everyday and i know where just about any classroom is. i almost changed my major as a matter of fact, just because i was so incredibly sick of the whole art scene. but, i thought about it for a while, and i realized that designing jewelry is what i truly want to make a career out of. it is really frustrating though, because all of the art classes are four hours long, twice a week, and i only get three hours of credit for them!  it is crazy!  i was going to actually apply to get into the design school, other than just studio w'minor in metals, but i went to the seminar for design and it is totally not what i had in mind. they do things like design posters, building, add things to computers in clip0-art and such and use things like digital cameras. we had to use digital cameras in my two dimensional design class yesterday and it was pretty cool. although i had no idea to what my teacher's motives were behind the assignment i actually had fun. she paired me up with someone in my class that i don't think i ever talked to until yesterday. we walked from the art building to the tower twice!  well, actually, we walked their twice because the camera we checked out said we could take 139 pictures. yet, after only taking five, the camera said our memory card was full. it made me so mad, but it was okay in the end because we ended up getting our assignment done on time. i keep glancing up at the timer on the top of my screen i think almost every time i finish a sentence. i actually like this exercise because, even though i am timed, i actually am making some good points to myself. it is so weird how writers find themselves writing their best work, when they are not even meaning to or realizing they are doing it at all.  i am definitely not saying this is one of my best writings, but i just remembered somebody telling me that a long time ago. i wonder what i will be doing after i finish writing this. right now i keep stopping every five seconds and checking the timer to see how much time has gone by. i am really hungry. i have not eaten anything since i think around 1030 this morning. i definitely should have grabbed something to eat before i started righting this, but oh well. what will i have for dinner?  hmm. i have no clue. i think after this, i will go ask one of my roommates to see if she can fix my computer because the aol doesn't work for somer reason. we just got our internet connection today, which is another reason why i am just now doing this assignment.

"it is quiet in my room, josh is asleep and all i hear is the fountain that i bought at sam's gurgling and trickling in the background i wonder if it will ever break, no it probably won't because it has a one year warranty the room is cold all of the day except for right now when it is hot outside and warm in here why doesn't the school let us have our own a'c units it is a pretty neat school though, i can't wait until i see my girlfriend, it kinda makes then end of the week have some meaning to me for a change, i don't think i talk that much on the phone, i think it's more like ahh i really don't know, but it's not that much when i type, the fountain's sound kinda melts into the background, and i almost forget that it's there, and then when i stop it comes back again, i guess my mind focuses on the clicking of the keys, and once they stop, then it tunes in to aural noise it's only been 8 minutes and i feel like i've been typing for a really long time, i wonder if the kids who were putting up a fit about having to use the computers for this assignment are actually going to do it, my mom's that way about computers, it's not so hard to get a hang of, besides, it beats writing on paper for sure i think i need some more paper for the printer and then a new computer and a guitar i hope i win the lottery so i can buy the computer and the guitar, i think i can swing the paper, though man, they weren't kidding about poor college kids, i never thought i would actually be subsisting on 6 hours of sleep and  those damn ramen noodle cups that i'm sure are poisoning me even as i speak or rather type, but at least they aren't as poisonous as jester food i think there was some human in that burger i just ate, my stomach knows for sure what it ate, but i just can't figure out what it is maybe i should order chinese food and hope fully there won't be real chinese people in it because that would probably upset my stomach too i really don't like people who eat people but i dislike people who eat tarantulas even more, that was so gross seeing them on the sticks at the natives roasted them over the fire actually, i like the discovery channel quite a bit, it sure beats the dumb talk show about love triangles between a man and two dogs of different sexes that type of stuff pollutes the airwaves much like a sort of flying landfill i wonder where all the trash is going to go in the near future, i think they should make the criminals eat it or recycle as much of it as they can i think my room puts out more coke cans than the entire state of texas but at least we recycle them back home i get money for doing it but here i just get sticky fingers and a desire to drink another coke i wonder if you could put a pool table in here, that would be cool and so would a tiger, i always wanted a tiger, one of those black and white bengals but i would have to get it fixed and declawed and maybe dull it's teeth or something i think if i had one then nobody would complain because it is a tiger after all, and i could say sic-em and the tiger would bite off their heads or something now i really wand a tiger, but i would settle for some neons in my fish tank, i wonder where they are sold. . . .

"i have a lot of stuff to do tonight. i'm glad i'm getting this done relatively early. i wont have to worry about it when it comes time to turn it in. i usually don't get assignments done thiis quick but i have a lot of stuff to talk about soi thought i'd go ahead and do it. i found out about bonnie having breast cancer today and that just adds to the fact that meme has cancer as well. that's two people in one week that i'm close to that have found out that they have cancer. i haven't known many people in my life wit hcancer and all of the sudden this happens. i really wish they didn't have to go through kemo therapy. it seems so primitive and i hope a more efficient and effective cure is found soon. i talked to rachel tonight. i know we will probably never have anything but the situation with her mom may bring us all very close. i love them like my own family and i know that me and mom are ready to fly out there anytime we're needed. five minutes have gone by and i'm already tired of typing. i'm excited about seeing ashley this weekend. i miss her. i'm really looking forward to meeting all of seth's friends. he says they're all hot so this ought  to be a good weekend. i'm glad everything has worked out with seth and my parents. i feel a lot more happy when i talk to rachel. she still has that effect on me even after the rough time we had this summer. i still think she is one of the finest girls i have ever met. i just got a new email but i can't check it for another ten minutes and that is going to drive me crazy. i have to clean my truck out tomorrow. after starr dumped that frapuccino all over the place, it has stunk in there. this is a really good song. i like listening to heartbeats on the beat. somethimes they depress me though. i wish i could send one out to someone special. i'm sure she's out there; i just have to be patient and not try to force anything to happen. i have a really good life. it would be much better with a girl but i can do without untill the right one comes along. i'm so excited about going to vail for new year's. we're going to have so much fun. i'm glad kim is going. she is so cool and my best friend in the world. kelly is such a good cook. so is mom. those were both very random. i'm not sure where i want move next year. i pretty much have any option open since brannon lives in some of the most expensive appartments in the city. i only have five minutes left. this is a cool assignment. i like to just sit down and write my feelings for a while sometimes. it helps t osoothe my nerves. i really wish i could check my mail. i have a lot of readiign to do. i love this stuff we're talking about in psycology. i'm not just trying to suck up or anything because i figure dr. penn wont even read this. it is all just really intriguing to me and i am haveing so much fun. i hope meme and bonnie are both alright. i want to see the ellenburgs again. i hope they come out and see us soon. i want to see rachel again, too. and reagan.

"okay i guess i should begin this by mentioning a little bit about me i guess that's one thing we can i mean i can talk about. i was wondering when i was going to put a period in. that's one thing i'm bad at, i forget to put periods. i hate computers especially when they act up i mean i don't hate them it's just there so sensitive almost like people. people are sensitive to things like for instance today this guy i was talking to. i brought up why i had only seen him say hi to hispanics. because i feel that you should be as friendly with every sort of people. however i know he's not a racist but i just wanted to bring that issue up to him to hear his response. this question was what my other friend said had made him mad. but hey i'm just frank like that i can't help it. i think now that i'm getting into the mode of things i'm starting to realize how my old self is coming out of me but i told myself that i was going to be me. not to stop or halt to my small voices in my head. actually its just one i don't want to give you all the idea that i'm schizo or anything. however i wanted what drugs can do to one. is there any positive effects from psychedelic drugs? but i'm too afraid to find out that answer. that is something that i've noticed here in campus. it seems to be the main issue at hand but i also think that i just may surround or interact with people with a drug background. like the book said you group yourself with people like yourself. that's so great about college, no matter who you are you'll find someone like you or for you. right now i'm working on the female part of that companionship. i read somewhere that right now at this age one is in an endless tireless search for love even to the extreme of promiscuity. but i guess its pretty lame talking about my love life on this assignment but """"hey"""" no one said i was confined to a set of topic. in fact, as i understood it. it's pretty much what we want to write about it. is that not true, i think so. notice how i'm burning time writing about nonsense. or b. s. as some might call it. i'm really glad that i didn't procrastinate this to the last second. the scary thing is that i'm doing this assignment at about twelve thirty or so. in that vicinity. i guess. i guess my time is up.

"well, i suppose since this is a stream of consciousness exercise i will just say whatever is on my mind, which at the moment happens to be how incredibly horrible this past weekend was. but, let's back up and get the basics down. for graduation, my grandparents promised to buy me a new computer. new, being the operative word. so they told me to go find one that i liked and tell them where it was. my mother and i went out and looked at computers and found a nice setup that included a printer for about $1500. we thought that sounded reasonable, so we informed my grandparents of the computer's location and they said it sounded good. however, they went to see my uncle's family in dallas for my cousin's birthday and decided to go a cheaper route and not buy a namebrand computer. so i ended up with this piece of crap that keeps shutting down on me. my dad has been freaking out for the past two weeks how he knew all along we should have gotten a different computer in the first place and how my grandparents always go the cheaper route even when it means less quality and now my entire college career is jeopardized because i cannot get online. so i spent saturday messing with my computer, trying to reinstall stuff to see if it was a software problem. it wasn't. my uncle drove in from dallas on sunday and took windows off, reinstalled it, deleted my c drive (which is a big deal), then created a new one and repartitioned it, everything seemed to work for a brief period of time before my computer decided to do one more mad little dance of irony and shut itself down. now i am stuck with a computer that doesn't even partially compute and my dad has to come pick it up to take it to some store called """"computer doctor"""" and meanwhile he's still ranting about how he was right all along and my mother should talk my grandparents into getting me a new computer, and if they don't how my parents should because if they don't i'm going to flunk because after all everything is online nowadays, etc. so i wasted my weekend sitting up in my room with my family when i could have been in the music room practicing. and i'm a music major, not computer science, so the music building is where i should be. but my mother wouldn't let me go to the music building because she wanted me to be around while they were messing with my computer. so i didn't practice at all this weekend when my professor says i should practice 4 hours a day at least, and i just got a bunch of new music and now i'm totally screwed for my lesson on friday. i also am having trouble in my music theory class because my teacher never bothered to tell me what an augmented interval or a diminished interval is, and they expect us to learn this stuff in one night, and since we have the class everyday, it's not like we can procrastinate at all. it's very frustrating. or maybe it's just me. i don't know. all i know is that i haven't even typed for ten minutes yet and i'm still complaining. it's not like i usually procrastinate about anything anyway. i mean, i was valedictorian of my high school, i think i know something about time management. although, being valedictorian of my school was no terrible feat. i went to all the parties and pulled all the typical high school stunts, and had the highest number of """"unexcused absences"""" you could have without being held back. and i wrote my speech at three in the morning the day of graduation. so i guess i know a little about procrastination anyway. but i had a reason for waiting that long really! when it was certain that i was going to be valedictorian, everybody started giving me tips, like they knew what they were talking about. """"don't make it too long, i'll pay you five dollars to say my name, don't make it too boring. i don't want to sit through some damn boring speech. """" even friends' parents were giving me tips. everybody wanted to know what i was going to say, so i just didn't even try to come up with anything until the last minute, so i wouldn't have anything to tell them. most people like me speech i guess. i worked in a favorite quote of mine by theodore roosevelt about how the real cowards are the ones who never try. it's a really encouraging quote, and i always used to repeat it to myself when i went to violin auditions because i am an extremely nervous performer. i also used to repeat that thing from dune by frank herbert that the main character paul used to say """"i will not fear. fear is the mind killer. fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. i will face my fear. """" etc, etc. it always sort of helped me get a grip on myself i guess which i need because i'm a very insecure person. and i'm sure that my typing is annoying my roommate right now because i have to use her computer and she's trying to sleep and her computer is right by where her head is on her bed. it's only 12:34 though, and she always goes to sleep around midnight which i think is weird. but then i'm an insomniac and i can never sleep anyway, so i'm usually up until about three. i also am a coffee addict. have been since the age of seven. i think it usually surprises people that i've been drinking coffee so long, but my dad used to drink at least a pot a day, to that was a drink that was always available. you'd think it would have stunted my growth, but i'm 5'7"""". then again, my brother is only 15 and he's 5'9"""", so maybe i would have been taller. maybe not. i sort of like my height. hmm, i've got two minutes to go, and i lost my train of thought, so i guess i'll just keep typing until something comes to me. oh, i'm listening to the soundtrack from """"schindler's list"""" right now. i totally love that movie and the music makes me cry. music always makes me emotional, but this cd is played by itzhak perlman whom i personally feel is the greatest violinist in the world, although joshua bell, who did the soundtrack for the """"red violin"""" is also really good, but younger so he doesn't have as much experience. i'm sure he will be so much better when he's older though. well, it's been twenty minutes. it was interesting. a little personal odyssey of the mind there. bye!

"right now i'm sitting here at the computer wondering what i'm going to type for the next 20 minutes. there is someone outside in the apartment complex fumbling with their keys, perhaps trying to open their door. my computer is making some noise, and the apartment is really quiet so it seems very loud. i keep on making typing errors which is getting very annoying! there is a lot of stuff on my desk, i need to clear it off. i also need to clean up the kitchen cause there are lots of dishes that were left there last night when a couple of my friends came over last night. i forgot to get batteries for my walkman at the store yesterday too. i need to study for chemistry because i have a quiz in there at 12:30. i tried to last night, but i kept on getting distracted. i don't feel like doing this right now. i want to go to sleep. i just got back from calculus, which was an 8:00 class, and all i want to do is sleep. by the time i get the chance to, it will be time to leave again. i can't think of anything to type. i want to light a candle. i have a lot of time left and i still need to write. i'm not sure what about though. this weekend i'm not sure what i'm going to do, but i guess i'll have fun. i did last weekend. i need to do some reading for my classes, and i can't wait until this day is over because my weekend can begin due to the fact that i don't have any classes on friday. right now i am thinking about different things we can plan for my best friend's surprise birthday in houston. we plan to have a party here for her too, but the one in houston will be a surprise because she has no idea that me and dag are planning it. next weekend i am going to the ut houston game and then right after that i plan on going home because the 24th is my dad's birthday and the 21st is my brother's birthday. that will be a busy weekend. the following one is my friend's birthday. my computer is still making some annoying noise. i can't think of anything to type. i have 10 minutes left of typing. hopefully i can come up with something for these remaining 10 minutes. i'm glad my apartment is on the 2nd floor because i noticed that yesterday when it rained that one of the apartments on the floor below had a puddle of water right in front of the door. that would be very annoying to deal with, if i lived there! so i'm glad i don't. yesterday there was a lot of traffic. today i get out of school at 3:30 and i have a trig review class at 5:30. i wish i didn't have to go, but i get extra credit for my calculus class, which i figure i will need. i need to balance my checkbook. i think i'll do that when i finish typing this. i'm going to listen to some cd's when i finish this too. i don't feel like studying, and i guess i'll have to figure out what to have for lunch. i wonder if the water filter we got makes the water taste different, i'll have to check that out in a minute. my desk is really cluttered, i need to get some envelopes and stamps, and mail those thank you letters that i keep on forgetting about. well, i have a lot more stuff to do than i thought! it's driving me crazy that i keep on making so many typos, i never have this problem. wow, i've finally written enough to start scrolling on the page! that's kind a cool. i thought that a i would have written more in 20 minutes though. i guess not. surprisingly the time went by very quickly, i didn't think that it would. i guess in a minute i will log on so that i can get on to the psychology website and send this in.

"i still need to do my homework for spanish. i'll be spending a lot of time in this building in the spring because i'll be back in design and vis comm. i'm getting hungry. tonight amy alex and i are going to get pizza. alex and i weren't getting along too well for a while. it was because i have been dating and spending less time with him. for a long time it was always just the two of us, neither one dating. now that i am it bothered him just a little bit. oh well, we talked about it and he's better now. which is good, i don't like to fight with alex. i have a lot to do this week, tonight i need to read and i would like to work on and ,ideally, finish my calculus homework. tomorrow i am going to apply for a job at the nature company in the mall. i talked to one of the managers this weekend at the forum and he said that they were hiring. that would be a good place to work, at least i like the store. we'll see. i guess i need to call my sister tonight she always gets all worked up if i don't talk to her once a week. i just talked to her the other day though, sometimes i just don't feel like talking to her. i hope that someday she'll stop trying to mother me. i hope that now that she has a child she will let me be. i actually sort of enjoy my calculus class. this is my first time to take calculus so i didn't know what to expect. it is pretty interesting. i'm really getting hungry and it s going to be a couple of hours before i get to eat dinner i wish my computer at home worked it is so annoying that the computer people are being so stubborn about fixing it. i 'm glad uncle mike is going to help me with it. mom really did a good job when she picked uncle mike to be my financial adviser ii really care for hm a lot. it is always  amazing to me that it is usually your friends that you can count on more than your family. you always are expected to help your family whether you like them or not but your friends are chosen and they like you and want to help with things and they won't hold it over your head. unfortunately most of the people in my family are big fans of the guilt trip. i can't stand that sort of thing.

"my stomach is really full from the waffles and breakfast sandwich i just finished eating. i keep smelling this minty sensation everywhere that i go. right after i finish this i have to go to thursday's website or pollstar to see when they are playing a show in san antonio. i feel slightly uneasy:  school is starting off to be surprisingly easier than i thought it would. i have to find a way to get more shifts at work so that i can continue to pay to go to school here. there's this band called brand new that rocks. i've been listening to their cds for the last month non-stop, they're coming around here in the next couple of months and don't know if i should go or so just save my money. then there's this girl who i can't stop thinking about. she is my ex-girlfriend and she treats me horribly, yet i can't stop myself from wanting to be with her. a couple of days ago i went and watched thirteen"""" (co-written and directed by a ut grad) with my friend lydia, who i hadn't seen in nearly two months. i know that every teenager on earth thinks that their life is the hardest and most complex thing to deal with, so i'll try not to complain about mine. my life has been pretty good, i've always done well in school and stayed out of trouble. i don't really party very much, i don't smoke or drink, which i get a lot of crap for considering one of my friends is the president of the hell raisers. people come up and tell me about their problems or i read the paper or watch the news and realize just how miniscule my """"problems"""" really are. i'm excited about the experimentation part of this class and hopefully i'll have time to sign up for it after i'm done with this but, we'll see. lately i've been acting really weird and doing things i wouldn't normally do. i started working out on a regular basis, which was always something that i tried to avoid with all my heart. i'm saddened by one of my favorite rap groups, bone thugs n harmony, who have hit an all-time low. they've gone from selling out the erwin center in '96 to opening for the insane clown posse and stubbs bbq. the saddening thing about that is that icp are the worst act to ever grab hold of a microphone. it's not possible to think of anything more painful than listening to one of their songs. it's people like those two idiots that make me lose faith in mankind. and the fact that there are people who actually listen to that filth religiously is seriously disheartening. i think i have to go to the bathroom, but i got to wait until i'm done with this and i've checked on thursday. then i have to make sure that i don't have any tests scheduled for the same night as a concert. i already have one conflict on oct. 30, when taking back sunday will be rocking the masses whilst i whittle away taking a math test. hopefully i can get done with the test in time to hustle over to stubbs and catch their set, it's a highly anticipated one and they shouldn't let down.

"it is a beautiful day outside and i hope to enjoy it as best i should i am listening to one of my favorite bands. this song matches my mood perfectly. i feel like i should be doing something with my life and i'm not, and it's very har to get along in this university without feeling lonely now and then. i find beauty in very conventionally ugly things and this is why i love photography so much. the pictures i have up on my walls reflect my personality a lot. there are so many aspects of me that people never get to see and it hurts when they judge without knowing me personally. i see in color in the sense that i see the most vibrancy and brightness in everything. my room here is finally starting to smell lik ehome and that's one of the first things i notice when i come in. i'm glad i ended up at ut. i thought i was kind of chickening out by coming here. it's the only place i applied to. i'm a freshman this year and i really hope to get out in 3 years, since i have 34 hours of credit from exams. i hope i can get out in 3 years because i want to feel good about myself and not feel inferior to my peers. i have a lot of issues about who i am and that's why psychology fascinates me so. i understand a lot of who i am more than most people my age. i'm feeling very wise right now and although my boyfriend is a year older than me, i sometimes feel years older than him. i might want to marry him someday and i worry about that. i miss the way things were 2 years ago when i was carefree i feel very burdened and i sometimes think i'm not experiencing college because i feel that way so often. i've always had so much to do that when i don't, i can't relax and i get really anxious. if i'm not stressed out i think i'm missing something. when i watched president bush speak last night i cried because i'm so worried that he will be reelected. i am an avid kerry fan and feel passionately about politics and when i hear bush lie and make empty promises and see people believe what he's saying it affects me deeply. i want to make a difference in the world someday. i hope i will grow to be someone great. my past relationships have been sneaking up on me recently an d things on that front are disturbing an dmaking me feel regretful. i there are some things that i remember so perfectly about the past and i don't know why they stick out. i know that there is something special inside me and i hope i can do something great in this world. i remember going to europe two years ago and feeling so happy with myself and who i was and i don't have any clue about that anymore. i find peace in knowledge. wondering stresses me out. i used to write a lot of poetry and i still feel just as expressive but now the words don't flow as well. i think that as i've grow up, my poetic naivete has faded as has any talent i had. i feel bery inferior to people that don't know me they look at me like i have no self worth and it bothers me. i am a government major and a psych minor but some people think because i'm in liberal arts i have no direction in my life and that is so frustrating. it frustrates me when people think i am stupid. i have almost no tolerance for ignorance yet i get mad when people do that. i am very analytical, mayb eoveranalytical, and its gotten me into a lot of trouble in my life i miss conor and what we had a few years ago and i miss our friendship i need to feel safe and comforted in order to be successful and i am very dependent on other people in my life to do that for me. when we weren't 100 miles apart i miss justin in many ways and that bothers me he was the most detrimental person in my life and still is so far and last night i was thinking about those three days that were the worst in my life and there is only 1 thing i can do to get past that. i don't know if i will ever. one of my main goals in life is to be understood and i feel very misunderstood by people that don't take the time to get to know me and i feel that the first impressions i give are not very accurate. i am very emotional and i know that just thinking about certain things will make me burst into tears it makes me feel inferior to do that. i feel guilty when i cry because things could be a lot worse. i want this world to improve and i want to help it do so. i need a lot of love. ramon and i have something really special he makes me feel so loved we have been together for two whole years and i want to be with him forever i want to make him happy and i want him to make me happy until we are old and i want to share everything i have with him. i wasn't sure about that until recently but now i feel more passionately about our relationship than i ever have. sometimes i cry out of neither sadness nor happiness and its hard to explain to anyone else it feels like i cry out of understanding a complex emotion that i never was able to before. if a song really touches me and i connect to it i will almost definitely cry. i think that makes me special. i think i am more compassionate than most people. music is one of the most powerful mediums of communication there is it makes me feel freer than anything else except possibly writing. the sound of this song is so familiar and it reminds me of good memories  ",0
"the thought of everyone or anything making sense is no sense at all. people or things are living to be apart of the same things. to understand the most simplest of things is to want to understand the hardest of things. if we were to understand all that is around us then what? we seem as humans to conquer all that is unknown or well known as something we can overtake. why is this? if we understood everthing about ourselves then would we conquer overselves and in turn become so self absorbed that it turns out for the worst? maybe our own minds are the foundation and key to unlocking every mystery that lies in this world. that may be the reason that it is so complicated, since it does not want to be discovered in fear of damnation. we find ourselves seeking that which is not wanting to be sought after. maybe if we just left the hinding unknown come to the surface on its own then the world would be more peaceful than ever. we want to satisfy and gratify each other yet nothing is truly workin as a whole. in that case why don't we curse each other? would this work? there wouldn't be heroes without tragic situations that call on them. there wouldn't be compassion without suffering. this may be the other mystery of life. we suffer from all sorts of pains. anxiety, stress, and heartache. then this may be the key to how the  world goes round. there must always lie a purpose or mystery to be solved or individuals would possibly goe mad. living without purpose. the sights that are before us lie challenges that we all must go through. . animal. man. all the same in our   civilized  , yet primal instincts. we find that the more of one thing evolves another becomes a mystery. we try to understand our primal side of existance yet this is where we come from. our strive to learn, succeed, or conquer friends and foes. the animal coming out of us? no the animal coming back to us. these triumphes or downfalls are the minds tricks on itself that keeps everthing from total damnation. if we did unlock the nooks and crannies of our world then what then. find a way to kill or destroy it. with everything else we have. from finding how the world turns, our habits have caused an imbalance of many levels. the people all around us are capable of so much together that the universe wouldn't stand a chance. but that may be the reason we coannot truly get the whole picture of how we really feel for one another. the thoughts that we have are very primal. we seek out our sexes to comfort a zone but not a domain. if we all truly united then our common strength could destroy rntire galaxies since we have already done fractions of that with partial unification. this may be the clue to how realtionships may work in general. we find ways to unite and ways to spread out. everything that may be silly to an outsider like colthes, sex, or religion. these pose for issues that seperarte us at the same time. the same that our animal instincts may tell us as they come back and not come out as many think. think about the possibilities. or the downfalls. mysteries of any sort are our key that may never be unlocked       ",1
"     i can't seem to picture anything but just seem to think of silence and the color white. it also seems to help me think of me sort of like a simple person and how my mind is thinking of my personallity and the color white as if i am a boring person. then i think that it is not the color that best represents me because i really believe i am outgoing and that the color white is dull and really not me. i seem to be distracted by the air condition in my apartment as if everything i am thinking is interupted my the noise of the air. blue pops into my head sort of associating the air with the color blue but now it seems as if that is impossible because you can't see air then why would i associate it with the color blue, maybe because it is the color that artists have used in the past to associate wind with. now i have a song by puff daddy in my head and all i know is that i repeat inside my head  the same verse   as long as we're here we might as well shine together   i wonder if they are actually his words because before he has been accused of copying words from other artists. yet it is surprising that i am writing so much and not complaining, maybe because everything is just poping into my head this is different i usually don't think of anything. now i am thinking i don't pay enough attention to myself enough as if i ignore what my minds says. if once i could actually stop and think what my mind says like i am doing right now maybe i would be a better person and i wouldn't be in the position i am put in all the time and maybe just maybe i would'nt be in trouble all the time. now that i say trouble i think of my girlfriend and start to wonder what she is doing and maybe what she is thinkning. isn't it weird how we rather see what otherpeople are thinking rather than seeing what you yourself is thinking. i just thought that was weird but true. now i wonder what all this means all these mixed thoughts without no real sense in them. how can a test be made to tell me what or how i think that's weird. but then again that is the 21 century for you staring right at your face. were there tests that could tell you how you thought 100 years from now or is this just something recent. that last sentence seems stupid like if i were asking the air and waiting for a response. it is raining outside and it is the first time i see rain in austin because i am not from around here it is amazing how the sound of the rain makes me want to sleep but now after so long i found out that rain or the weather does not affect a persons mood. thats weird if there were anything that i was certain in psychology was that it did affect your mood or the way a person felt. just now i wonderd why do they say that if there is an eclipse it is bad for a preganant women. just out of now where i thought that. is it bad? wait a minute who am i asking thats weird how i still want to know something and rather than asking someone who might know something about the subject i rather ask myself to see i really can not come up with an answer. i wonder where my parents are if they are at work or if they are at home and if it is raining there too like it is here or my brothers where are they who knows we hardly see eachother anyways so it is as if i were home ",1
"must i write for 20 minutes? why? what exactly does writing as i think, called my """"stream of consciousness"""" prove? i suppose magical thoughts that exploit my deepest darkest secrets will arise or something. of course they could if i really got bored because my mind does jump sporadically from idea to idea but who knows? it never stops and i can never focus on one thing for very long before i get bored. i think i have add or something because it is hard for me to focus for extended periods of time which i'm sure if that's a fault of mine or genetic or experience because of tv and how american society has raised me. american society is crap. everyone blames violence on tv as the problem with the current """"violent"""" america. kids watching violent shows does not make a kid violent. rather parents not telling their kids that violent shows are fake or parents that are violent or parents that tell kids violence is ok is what makes kids violent. it's stupid to blame entertainment, of course there are some cases where the tv is too blame. we cannot simply say it never does but we also cannot say that it's the root of the problem. the problem is parents and society today. 40 years ago parents would never let kids do the things kids do nowadays. drugs, alcohol, sex and everything else has become much more liberal. lets face it, all these things sell and so now we have corporate america where only the strong survive, or get rich, whichever. how the hell can you call this country so great when there jobless, starving and homeless people everyone, including children. yeah sure for the 95% of people with jobs, even then i'm sure a good % of those people with jobs still struggle to make it. they bust their butts day in and day out to get what they can for themselves and their family yet we're experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in however many years like it matters to those people who are still unemployed or working crappy minimal wage jobs. yeah, great country america is. i'm listening to this nice piano soloist on cd on my computer as i type for this long 20 minutes and it's quite pleasant. whenever i listen to this i think about the girl who gave it to me, marie tesi. even though she's getting kind of fat, i still find her attractive. it's very unusual for me to find an asian attractive, well at least in the past. i find a lot more attractive here at ut nowadays because i think i just had a town full of ugly asians or something, who knows eh? well anyway, i was so """"in"""" to her, never could get her off my mind. i think i have a problem with obsessing over people, well girls, when i like them. i've never had a girlfriend and i've never even had the courage to ask a girl out. i'm so insecure it's not even funny. i wish i could suddenly build up courage and ask a girl out or even get a little kiss or sex or something. i'm no different than any other guy and one good thing is i rarely masturbate so luckily sex doesn't drive my mind and life. i can focus on other things such as watching tv, playing video games and talking to people. i think i want to be a psychologist, the phd level, so i can do research or get paid lots of money to advise people. people and their pasts interest me a lot, it's freaking amazing what you learn about people when they actually open up to you. you hear about traumatizing experiences and good experiences and stories of best friends and family and deaths and everything else you can imagine. it's all fascinating to me, i love to hear about it and try to piece together how these experiences have made the person the way they are. it's pretty cool to also, for me because i keep being told i'm really easy to talk too. be it guys or girls, i hear the same thing. so i feel as if i have some sort of gift or something that allows people to talk to me and sometimes that's all a person needs is someone to sit there and listen to another person talk and they will feel so much better. given i don't know what to say many times but i know how to empathize and sympathize with people because i feel that i've experienced enough pain, hurts, injustices throughout my life so i'm not totally oblivious to everything. i, for the most part, understand that not everything is black and white, there is always a gray area that cannot have a simple answer. there must always be a compromise that comes from both sides or else it will be black and white and life would be boring. life is boring as it is, why make it more so? a few thrills here and there but life usually is one big long path to death. how you live your life makes who you are and how you are in the end. is there an end? well there could be but that depends on what you believe in. whether it be christianity or buddhism or hinduism or any of the ism's, you know where you're going or think you know where your going. so what about atheists?. well you simply cease to exist. isn't that a scary thought? you die and that's it, the void. you don't exist anymore. you are no longer conscious and it's like you were never alive. people remember you but you are forgotten once they die unless your a martyr or a hero or king or anything of that sort, but for the most part you are forgotten within 23 generations. and my 20 minutes is up so i'm done.

"first, it took me a long time to get through the austin traffic. then, when i got home, and called jenny, she wasn't ready to come over. she came over anyway even though she hadn't shaved her legs. that was kind of bad. next, i still had to deal with the fact that she had messed around with justin, one of my supposedly good friends. all they did was kiss, but it still really hurt me. she had told me that it would never happen again after she and kevin messed around, but she lied. i can't believe that she did that. then i told her about the fact that i had sex with heather back during the summer, so she wasn't really happy about that, but that's understandable. i still love her, but she has really putting me to the test this weekend. hen, later on friday night, she told me that she had liked justin, so what happened wasn't as much of an accident as i had first thought it was. come to find out, she had gotten drunk at her apartment and then called justin to come over. that's when the kiss happened. that really hurts me. so she told me that, but she still wanted to have sex with me. i agreed, i don't know why, but i did. and then, in the middle of it, she started crying, that really hurt me. then after that, she told me that she didn't even want me to come with her to college station with her. that tore me apart. i didn't know how to handle it, so i freaked, i just started yelling at her. i don't know why, i should have been more calm , but i just couldn't do it. i tried to calm myself down, but nothing worked. i still can't believe how mean i was. and then, on saturday morning, i called her, because i thought she was going to leave without calling me like she said she would. and then, she told me that she had changed her mind, and now she didn't want me to go again. then i freaked again. i started yelling at her. i was really hurt, like id never been hurt before. i couldn't believe that anybody could hurt me this bad, but she could do it. s i called justin, and got a ride with him to college station. it took me an hour and a half to eat my mcdonalds lunch. i had lost my appetite. i was miserable. kenny could see that. i got to a&m, but i had no desire to party, all i wanted to do was talk to jenny so that i could apologize to her for what i said. i ate like half my dinner. it was good but i just didn't want to eat. so, we went to the party, and i was miserable, people were drinking and all i wanted to do was talk to jenny. finally, kenny gave me the number to amy's cell phone. so i called it, and amy wouldn't let me talk to jenny. then kristen answered and she wouldn't let me talk to her, and then james, her brother wouldn't let me talk to her. i was really hurt. so i got her brothers number from justin. she had given it to him. that really hurt me, that she gave her  cell phone number to kenny, and her brother's number to justin. that devastated me. i just wanted to cry. it just wasn't fair. then justin called her, and convinced her to come to the party. he handed me the phone, but she really wouldn't say anything to me. i was crushed again. the one thing that i loved more than anything in this life, including myself wouldn't even talk to me. i have never felt so bad. i wanted to crawl in a hole and die, but i couldn't do that, i had to stay semihappy for the party. it was all an act, i was not happy at all. finally, at 1230 she came over. she wouldn't even acknowledge me. her roommates hate me now, and they weren't afraid to let me know. fuck amy, i hate that bitch. i have never liked her. i just want to beat her fucking head in. she is a stupid dirty whore. i don't care if she hates me, i hate her. i feel bad that cristin hates me. i like her. i really regret saying anything bad about her. then breiane came out and tried to start a fight with jenny. she claimed to be my friend. fuck her. she s a bitch. she acts like a stupid tease. she a dumb tease, she never gives anybody anything. she just likes to pretend like she's a whore. i don't really like her anymore, but it still hurts me that she doesn't want to have a friendship with me. and then, on the way home i got a speeding ticket. oh after i talked to jenny, i got a half-as hug, and then she hugged justin and didn't want to let go. then she didn't even say good-bye to me. i was hurt again. back to the speeding ticket, it was for 70 in a 30. i'm going to be fucked if my dad finds out. she didn't call me on sunday like she said she would. that really hurt. i wanted to call her so bad, but i couldn't, i wanted to so bad, not even funny. on monday, i talked to her for two hours, it was great, we made out. i liked it so much. she didn't call me last night. she called me this morning at 7. it woke me up. i love her, but she hasn't called me tonight yet. i really want to talk to her, so i hope that she calls me tonight. i stayed up to 3 waiting for her last night, then i fell asleep. tonight, i wont make that same choice. i'm going to go to bed early tonight.

"i'm not sure since i've just started college and haven't had any tests yet. i need to be working it my girlfriend has started to grab me and choke me but now i'm getting hungry but wait she started licking my ear and stroking my stomach but is it going to rain today and will i ever get some sleep. not if i have to keep typing this damn assignment. but who needs sleep anyway i wondering if i have any beers left in the refrigerator and if the born on date is really when the beer was born. two really nasty people just walked by outside the make me say to myself damn those people are nasty but who am i to judge people for being nasty. my girlfriend just said that i'm nasty but who cares she still kisses me. i need to be working so i can make money to pay for this damn class that is taking up all my time and keeping me from getting any sleep so that i have to worry about being tired at my job and then losing my job and not being able to pay for this damn class which i'll probably make a bad grade in anyway because i don't have enough time to study since i have to work to. oh i'm wondering if they are going to open the ut tower again and if some people will find out just how tall the tower is. i don't think it should be opened because if people are stupid enough to jump off the tower, they would have went somewhere else and jumped off something else. it has been a very gloomy weekend that was once again to short. but live moves on sometimes a very slow pace and sometimes at a more rapid pace. my significant other is wondering what i'm typing right now, so i am going to type faster so that she can't read everything that i just typed about 15 minutes ago. anyway, i'm tired of typing and a fat whale just walked by outside, so i have to go chase her so that i can return her safely to the ocean. alright then bye know because i've been typing for twenty minutes and i need to go smoke a cigarette.

"it's three thirty in the afternoon right now, and i'm working on my psychology homework. this is a very interesting assignment; i've never done one quite like this. it's actually quite easy--just putting my thoughts on this site and having it timed. quite fascinating. i'm excited today because i finally got my internet and cable installed!! it's been almost 2 weeks since i've been able to watch tv on my own and to use my own internet to get online!! i don't know how i made it, but i'm still alive. hehe. i'm glad that the time-warner people finally got the address right. the first time they came, the went to the wrong apartment complex!! how aggravating!! i've never been more miserable in my entire life!! but today, i'm feeling competely opposite!! ahh. the joys of modern technology. right now, my desk is hurting my arms. since i'm typing, the fleshy part of my arm is getting pushed into the edge of the desk, thus creating a groove in my skin which is sometimes painful. other than that, i'm ok. oh, but my chair is also making impressions on the back of my leg. i'm wearing shorts now so the back of my legs have a cloth pattern on them. my computer is working fine right now, which i am very grateful for. my friend stephen just instant messenged me, but i can't really reply back to him right now since i am doing this writing assignment, which is timed. i feel like i am writing a lot, but perhaps it is because i type fast. hmm. could be. well, i seem to be making many typos. i guess i should slow down and think of what i am writing before i write it. i sometimes get ahead of myself when i am thinking of what to write and it wreaks havoc on my typing. twenty minutes is a long time if you think about it. i mean, i've typed all of this in just seven minutes and twenty three seconds. i'm also trying to figure out which of my friends i should call to help me with the downloading of music. it's the greatest thing on the internet, but somehow i can't get it to work as efficiently as they can. all they have to do to play a song is click the list of songs that they have on the side of their screen, but when i want to play a song, i have to pull up a separate folder. bleh!! so i need to call one of my friends. but who should i call?? let's see. there's stephen, who im'ed me, rex, maria, sarika (she's going home this weekend though), mitra, lindsay (or is it -ey?), maria, her boyfriend zack, her boyfriend's friend stephen, ha, tahera, or jessica. i'm sure i know more people, but i can't think of them right now. the sad thing with the people i just listed is that almost all of them went to the same high school as i did. i need to meet new people. i can't hang out with the same few people every single day. but it's so hard to meet people when the classes have hundreds of people in them each. i go to class sitting next to a different person every single time. i rarely see the same person in my classes. i guess that's what i get for taking all the introductory classes. this stream of consciousness thing is cool. i'm thinking about my syntax (haha. such an ap english 4 word) and it's weird. i never normally talk like this. i feel as though i am babbling to myself or trying to sound intelligent as i babble. i guess i don't talk in an ignorant way, but i feel as though i sound more sophisticated than i really sound in real life. so i might go see a movie with my friends next friday entitled   one hour photo.   the ever so famous robin williams is in the movie, along with the very appealing guy from the hit show alias, michael vartan. the show alias is really cool--this girl named sydney, played by jennifer garner, is this spy'counterspy and she does all this cool stuff with all her high tech gadgets. and michael vartan plays her handler. now i'm talking on the phone with my friend maria. she called about what we want to do tonight. so we might play monopoly. apparently rex brought monopoly. or maybe it's rex who has it. i don't know. all i know is that now i have to call rex and see if he wants to play monolopy after his chinese bible study thing. i went to this chinese'taiwanese association thing the other night, and i felt so white-washed. that means that i don't feel like i'm as asian as them. i guess that could be a bad thing, but it probably was because half of those people were fobbish. fobbish means that they just got to the states so they're still really foreign-like. it kind of makes them stand out, but if they're ok with it, then it doesn't matter. i'm almost finished!! woohoo!! now i have to go call rex and see what we're doing tonight. good bye!

"i am so stressed out right now i don't even know what to do. if it's not one thing it's another. everything seems to be coming at me all at once and there is no escape. i'm trapped. i have so much inside that i want to let out, and sometimes i don't know what to do with myself. there are just too many pressures. sometimes i wish i could ignore all the pressures and just have fun and everything would still be okay. but it wouldn't be. sadly, i'm stuck with all of these barriers that keep me from being who i really want to be. i wish i could just be mary all of the time. but, it's impossible. i'm always too worried about everything, but i think you're better off worrying than just not caring at all. i always seem to look at many things in a different perspective than most people. i also find it hard to express those perspectives. most people just don't care, but i seem to fret over everything. maybe i'm obsessive, i don't know! but to top it off, i'm pretty happy where i am today. i guess all the fretting over tests and exams in the past got me where i am today. i can't believe how some people really are. some people i know are on so much alcohol or drugs, that that's all they think about, and forget about life and forget about their dreams. they let their life pass them by, and before they know it they'll be a big nobody in the world. i don't want to waste my lifetime like that. while i'm still young i want to take so much advantage of the opportunities that i have. i would love to contribute to the world and be the best person i can possibly be. i don't care what anyone says or thinks about me. i know the truth, and no one can judge me accept god. i want to be able to smile at the world and the world to just smile back. but the world is not that nice. it is such a mean, ugly world that sometimes i wish i didn't live in it. but the world can also be a magnificent thing to experience. there's just so much you can do, but it feels like so little time. sometimes i'm scared that there won't be enough time to do whatever it is that i want to do. a friend once told me to do at least one thing a day that scares you. i like that advice. there's so much inside of me that i want to explode! and i wonder if this feeling will disappear with age. well, i certainly hope not. i want to be 85 and feel like i'm still 15. a lot of times i wish i were 3 or 4 again with no worries or responsibilities. i believe being around that age was the best time of my life. i had no real care in the world. i was too confused to. i had no idea i actually existed in the outside worldi just was. well, i could go on forever but i got things to do. i kind of like this assignment. it's neat. well, i don't want to bore you or anything, and i think my 20 minutes is up! so, it was nice chatting with you dr. p!

"i'm feeling a little stressed right now. i have two tests coming up in about a week and i'm kind of behind on my reading. there is so much stuff to take care of now that i am out on my own. it makes me miss my family; i'm feeling kind of homesick right now. when i woke up this morning i found myself crying. i'm having a little bit of trouble because this guy in a really intense e-mail told me how much he likes me. it just happens to be my friend's brother so i'm worried about what i should do. i don't really have anyone to talk to about it and i just wanted someone to comfort me and hug me. but, i did talk to my friend today and he helped me out, i'm glad i had someone to talk to.     i'm thinking about going to a movie tonight with my section but i'm not sure because i think i need to stay and study. but, i think i'm going to go anyway because i need a break and i need to feel more involved. hopefully some people will go. i wonder what i should wear. i want to go shopping, i'm getting tired of always wearing the same things. it kind of smells like spoiled milk in my room. there are still boxes everywhere and i feel lazy for not getting rid of them, but i just don't feel like it. i keep hearing door open in the hall, i wonder if my room mate is back. it's kind of awkward with her here. i don't really know what to say and she is not very talkative. i still can't believe she told me to be quiet so rude like she did the other night. oh well.      i'm watching this movie on tv about a drill team and it makes me miss dancing. i mean i know i'm still taking classes, but its just not the same, it's not as often. it makes me feel out of shape, i hope that i don't gain a lot of weight because i'm not working out as much. it felt so good to be back in class the other day. i love the modern class, it feels so good to be able to move again and that class makes me feel free. i guess it's more laid back because the dancers aren't experienced and i'm one of the most experienced in the class. that kind of makes me relax because i don't get as nervous as i do around all the good dancers in the other classes. i get so nervous at auditions. i don't know how in the world i'm going to get into those major's dance classes. then what am i going to do?        my ra just knocked on my door to tell me that we are going to that movie. i feel kind of stupid going because i've already been and my friends aren't going. but, oh well, i guess that i will just go. i feel like i need to meet more people. the only people i've have hung out with while i have been here are rockport people. i thought i was going to get away from all that, but i don't know. i don't know what to write anymore. i'm thinking to hard about this and i know i shouldn't be. i should just type whatever it is that i am thinking.      the time is almost up. it went by surprisingly fast and i kind of enjoyed doing it. it actually made me feel a little better and sorted things out for me. it's weird how writing can do that; professor pennebaker did mention that in my class. i guess it really is true. i feel like i should have an ending to this. but, i guess not. i guess your thoughts never really end. it kind of makes me nervous when i can't think of what to write. what does that mean?  it's kind of like when i blank out talking to people which i seem to do a lot. i'm kind of interested in how this experiment thing will turn out. i wonder what the point of it is.

well. how do i start? i suppose i'll just start by saying that i am very tired of school i don't even know why so soon i mean my classes aren't all that bad yet but i'm tired of waking up so early to catch the crowded bus and always having to walk everywhere in the heat one thing i am excited about is my boyfriend coming down in less than 9 days to visit me. he's from texas tech and i miss him so much the only bad thing is that i think that i'm hiding myself from the world because i feel safe enough with him that i block out the rest of the world and therefore i am not quite as social as i should be. but i'm really worried that i'm going to lose him and then where will i be? who will i have? oh well can't think of that right now. i'll enjoy my life with him for now long distance relationships are very hard. i don't quite know what will happen but i do know that he is very special to me and every guy i go out with in the future will be compared to him enough about the mushy stuff i'm living with my sister up here its really convenient she takes care of me and we don't really fight a lot she's sick right now i don't know what to do except for buy her medicine i'm a bad nurse oh wells i can't believe we have been in school for bout 2 weeks now. it feels like 2 months everything is moving by so slow i miss dallas i can't wait to go back and visit my family and friends ill be going back in bout 2 weeks or so i hate it that i'm easily distracted when i start on my homework the tv usually gets to me because we have cable and so some really good movie will be on and ill sit there and watch it instead of working on my homework. that's really starting to become a habit and the thing is when the show is finally over and i start on my homework its already 12 and i'm pooped i need better study habits i'm currently a biology major. i don't even think that's what i'm going to follow through here i don't go out partying like most college students i think i should take advantage of my college years here but i really don't like the whole clubbing experience i'm full and i feel like vomiting. i think i ate too many chicken wings. oh wells i hate the computer i'm on the internet connection is really slow and i hate tying on a laptop computer. i'm use to the normal ones i still have a lot of reading to do i have to finish reading in this class and in biology. i hope i don't bomb any of my classes my parents expect me not to since my sister is here and will show me the ropes. do you know how much pressure that is? i feel as if i never seem to make my parents proud enough it comes with the territory. being the middle child is really hard anyways. i miss chili our chinchilla ill get to keep him for about 3 weeks so i'm really excited our apartment is so messy we live like boys i'm getting really tired already. i think ill be up late yet again tonight ill shower tomorrow morning i've dyed my hair 5 times and yet it wont give me the color i want i'm so frustrated i'm frustrated with life with school with love everything when i took the pretesting thing i felt so depressed. everything i was answering about myself was so negative. in some way and so i felt really bad once i was done. that reminds me i have to go check out that bulletin board to check out some experiments i could to do obtain my 5 hours actually now 3 1'2 which is great. i hope they don't make me do anything really weird i'm kind of hesitant to do that stuff oh wells i haven't been out a lot since i've been here in austin i'm kind of homesick. i miss the simple life i lead when i was in dallas everything has changed things are not so simple anymore i fell as though i'm not as happy here i don't know why though. don't worry. i'm not suicidal or anything i just wish i knew what was bugging me i think. actually i hope things will be fine soon this year is moving by so slow. and its so hard making friends i have at least one friend in each class except for chemistry that really bad because you should really have a study partner in that class i think ill have to make friends in there soon i feel stress stress from the world everything i hate it i get stressed easily sleep is overcoming me. i have to stay awake. i'm already behind in my readings can't get even more behind. i need a major massage my shoulders are so tense. my whole body is tense i like these kinds of writing assignments because it helps release some of my emotions hidden inside some stress has lifted but there's still a lot there well. my time has ended. its been 20 minutes 20 minutes that have flown by ill end it on this note. i need some sleep. i'm going to sleep goodbye. ,0
"well, here we go with the stream of consciousness essay. i used to do things like this in high school sometimes. they were pretty interesting, but i often find myself with a lack of things to say. i normally consider myself someone who gets straight to the point. i wonder if i should hit enter any time to send this back to the front. maybe i'll fix it later. my friend is playing guitar in my room now. sort of playing anyway. more like messing with it. he's still learning. there's a drawing on the wall next to me. comic book characters i think, but i'm not sure who they are. it's been a while since i've kept up with comic's. i just heard a sound from icq. that's a chat program on the internet. i don't know too much about it so i can't really explain too well. anyway, i hope i'm done with this by the time another friend comes over. it will be nice to talk to her again. she went home this weekend for labor day. so did my brother. i didn't go. i'm not sure why. no reason to go, i guess. hmm. when did i start this. wow, that was a long line. i guess i won't change it later. okay, i'm running out of things to talk about. i've found that happens to me a lot in conversation. not a very interesting person, i guess. well, i don't know. it's something i'm working on. i'm in a class now that might help. the phone just rang. should i get it?  the guy playing the guitar answered it for me. it's for my roommate. my suitemate just came in and started reading this. i'm uncomfortable with that. he's in the bathroom now. you know, this is a really boring piece of literature. i never realized how dull most everyday thoughts are. then again, when you keep your mind constantly moving like this, there isn't really time to stop and think deeply about things. i wonder how long this is going to be. i think it's been about ten minutes now. only my second line. how sad. well, not really considering how long these lines are. anyway, i wonder what i'm going to do the rest of the night. i guess there's always homework to do. i guess we'll see. this seat is uncomfortable. my back sort of hurts. i think i'm going to have arthritis when i get older. i always thought that i wouldn't like to grow old. not too old, i suppose. i've always been a very active person. i have a fear of growing old, i think. i guess it'll go away as i age gradually. i don't know how well i'd deal with paralysis from an accident though. as long as i have god and my friends around, i'll be okay though. i'm pretty thirsty right now. there isn't much to drink around my room. ultimate frisbee, i haven't played that all summer. fun game, but tiring. i'm out of shape. i'd like to get in better shape, but i hate running. it's too dull for me. hmmm. it's almost over now. just a few more minutes. let's see if i make it to the next line. short reachable goals!  whatever. anyway, what else do i have to do tonight. i guess i could read some. my shirt smells like dinner. it's pretty disgusting. i need to wake up for a 9:30 am class tomorrow. i remember when that wasn't early at all. well, i made it to the next line. i'm so proud of myself. that's sarcasm, by the way. i wonder if i was suppose to right this thing as a narrative. oh well too late now. time for me to head out. until next time, good bye and good luck. i don't know.

"it is 12:53 on tuesday and my roommate and i just finished eating lunch and  came down to the computer lab to work on our assignment. my computer in our  room is not hooked up to the internet yet, so for the time being i have to come  down here. that's ok. the guy just came over because we forgot to give him our  ids. oops. oh well. anyway, i'm really sad lately. i miss all my friends from high school. everyone i've met so far has been really nice and everything; i just miss how close we all were last year. i could go anywhere, to any school function, and see people that i knew and would feel comfortable with. here, it's not that there are so many people - it's just that there are so many  people that i don't know. every face that i pass on campus is another stranger. actually, i have seen a few people that i know from other places. earlier today i saw brittany. but it's just not the same as walking down the hall and knowing every single person. i was so comfortable there. i don't know. i should  probably be writing on the other assignment topic, since i'm going off about  high school and college and what have you, but i'm kind of just blabbering so  whatever. i am ready to be comfortable with lots of people again. i miss my comfort zone that i had at anderson and i want it back!!   hey!  i just looked at my watch and it has already been ten minutes. i guess i  can't really say that it's been ten minutes, because of that guy that came over. it's probably been more like seven minutes. i don't like this keyboard. it's kind of hard to type on. this assignment is actually harder than i thought it  would be. i mean, it's not hard, because i'm not really writing on anything in particular, but it is kind of hard to think continuously for twenty minutes. i think it's crazy that so many anderson people are in my psychology class. it  also freaks me out that alex is in our class. since you don't know about alex, just let me say that he is the most intimidating person in the world. i think  underneath that tough guy russian thing he has going for him he's really  probably a very nice person, but i don't know how easy it is for me to look past  the fact that he actually chased someone with an axe on the last day of school our junior year at city park. so i wouldn't fail alex if i were you. he might come to your office with his axe (do you spell it """"axe"""" or """"ax""""?  i don't know) or his machete or any of his other assortment of weapons that he totes around with him. i would really like to get to know him though - i think he would be an interesting person to get under his skin and see what he's really like. not to mention the fact that it would be cool to have him be your friend in case someone was giving you trouble. i think that time is probably almost up, but i would kind of like to keep  writing. i think i will. the temperature in this room is perfectly comfortable. i don't know where that thought came from. i am scared about having to write papers. what if my professors don't like the way i write?  i've always loved to write, but i like writing creatively. i'm pretty bad at comparing and  contrasting and all my research papers are boring. i mean i got good grades on  them, but later i'd go back and read them and be like """"hey did i actually write this?  yuck. """"  i think i'm probably being hard on myself. i wonder how many  times i have used the word probably in this assignment so far. i bet a lot. i hate when people don't know that a lot is two words and not one. i wonder what angie's deal is. she used to be so nice, but ever since dis and  i rushed she has been so rude. that's her problem, i know. and it kind of  always justifies the fact that i didn't like her that much. i always had to  act like i did, and she was nice enough, but just something about her has  always rubbed me the wrong way. that's what i told brian. brian -- what to do about brian?  i wish i knew i wish i could have some answer. i hate  leading  him on the way i did the other night, but that just seemed unavoidable. i know he needs me  and that's what i love about him. when i'm around him i feel  special and needed and important. but i just don't know if that is enough.

"i am thinking about a lot of things right now. i just got off of work a little while ago and just ate dinner. it was really good. i really like my nails that i just got done today and i notice they look really nice as i am typing. i hope i can do okay in college. this first week seemed pretty hard and it kind of scared me. i hope it gets easier. i am thinking about how i am going to arrange my experiments and where they are located. i had a really boring time at work today. i work with a guy that goes to southest texas state university and he is about to graduate. we have been talking about college alot lately and he has helped me. i have a boyfriend named trent. i have been with him for 2 years. i am off of work tomorrow which is good that i get a brak. i just got paid this weekend and i like getting paid. i am stuck and i don't know what to write about. thins is a really good assignment though. i like doing stuff like this. 20 minutes is a long time though and i hope my computer doesn't kick me off the internet becasue it sometimes does that. i am so full right now. i had a coney from sonic and i don't think i am going to eat for a whole week. i am so fat. ever since mid way through high school, i have been fat. being with trent has made me even more fat because we eat out a lot. he has gained a lot of weight also. i love him so much and i think about him all the time. i can't wait to get through college, marry hima dn start our family. we have a lot in common and we even want the same kind of kids, you know the genders in a certain order. well i am running low on thoughts. i can't seem to think of anything clearly when i need to most, like right now. i have done these things before, like i have said, but they have only been for 5 minutes at the most. i really like the idea of going to ut but it is going to be a major challenge. i see that it will take a lot of dedication to myself. i am planning on majoring in nursing. i really didn't know what i wanted to do and nursing seemed like it was good enough and i could still go to ut. i looked at all the positive things it had and right now in this day and age, nursing is very beneficial and can be done almost anywhere, not that i want to leave texas. i can't wait until my dad starts treating me like i am an adul since i am legally now. i wish he would let go. he says he is trying to work on it but he needs to do it faster. he needs to treat me like the 18 year old college girl that i am. he won't let me be as independent as i want to be. i don't know what else i can do to prove to him that i am raised and i can take it from here, just not quite financially. my fingers are starting to get cramped. i am getting really tired and the time is going to be up soon. i am going to look around a little bit more at my class web pages then i am going to lay down and go to sleepi miss dancing. i may not have been the best at it but i miss it from high school. maybe eventually i will get into something at ut if i am good enough. of course i need to loose a little bit of weight. i would like oto take one of the excersize classes since i can't afford to join a gym. i am discovering that i don't like my car as much as i did and i think i want something a little more sportier and maybe faster.

"i am sitting in my dorm room right now and i just thought it would be a good idea to go ahead and do my psychology homework because i don't have anything to do and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting on tv. i was so stressed out earlier today because i can not hack it in my calc. class. i went to class though only to affirm what i had previously believed. yeah right. i used to think i was pretty smart but being in that class made me see that i am not going to be able to excell in math or the college of natural sciences for that matter. simply for the fact that math is required. i am actually happier though because now i have eliminated one course of studies and narrowed my choices. i like that. i like feeling a little more directed with college and the future. i am leaning towards transfering to the college of communications. i also added rtf 305 to my schedule. i am so excited for it. people annoy the crap out of me. sometimes i wish i could just crawl into a box and never come out. call me a crab but i don't really care. i am what i am. i feel chubby right now. i want to eat but then i don't. i know the consequences of putting food in my mouth when i don't truly want it. wasters never want. . . good quote. very true. i have come so far in my life. i can't believe i am finally at college. . on my own. there are so many things to be thankful for in my life and in so many ways i am lucky. it is hard to keep a clear perspective all of the time. that is the problem with being human. . . we are always failing. falling short of the glory of god. it is so much more difficult to loose weight for the second time. i lost muscle and gained fat and now it takes longer and i also have more fat cells that will naturally hold on to the chubbs!! i will keep working on consistency and the important thing is to be persistant. i can't believe i used to sell knives this summer. seems like 3 years ago but it was actually just aboout ago. one day, i hope there is an invention to where you can eat and eat and eat and it wouldn't matter at all. i would pay good money for that. i am sure every woman in the u. s. would do the same. i bet my skin has a lot of sun damage. i tan too often but i do like the feeling and i am not going to stop.

"i have finally made it to college. i miss my family and friends but at the same time i am proud and happy with the changes that have come as a part of college life. it's is something new. i feel confident that i will succeed here at ut, but most importantly, i want to succeed. i am excited about all of my classes and look forward to gaining the knowledge that each professor has to offer. i sometimes worry about finding my special little niche here where there are so many students. however, each day i feel a little more comfortable with myself and the university. above all i find myself missing someone back home who i have only known a short time the most. he is a wonderful person with whom i have this extraordinary mental connection. being away from him has made me think more in detail about how the human mind and the concept of relationships depend heavily upon one another. it makes me wonder what abstract thought can make a person be able to relate everything  they see and do someway to another person. i am positive that it is not an obsession but it is something stronger than just a casual feeling. well i guess i will just have to continue to ponder about the whole situation.

first a bit of background  last friday on my way home at three in the morning my brother flipped our car and it rolled twice  i guess my last few days have been mainly taken up by thoughts of what happened i guess i am the kind of person who analyzes what they do after the fact and right now i'm trying to go through my emotions really wasn't afraid i wonder why i mean we were that close to death if we had flipped 10 yards later we would have fallen fifteen feet into a creek but as it was nothing happened so  really i just kid of went on with my life so i'm not dwelling on the crash what i am dwelling on is the fact that i was over the crash in a meter of minutes  this is the kind of thing that shapes many peoples lives but it seems to have no impact on mine  i'm not more or less kind i don't enjoy life more  i even had fun that weekend  i don't feel that i am truly any closer to god   i am not praying any more  not that that is how i judge my relationship with god but even how i judge my relationship a no closer  weird i should have done this later on i think better at night but if i wrote what i was thinking on here tonight instead of on paper i would lose these thought so i guess it is better this way i can always rewrite what i type onto paper but then i would feel the urge to revise and i haven't fully come to the conclusion whether that is right or wrong yet i mean what is what i truly think and feel what is  spur of the moment and straight from the heart or what is what i can put together over time so i haven't yet presented myself with the option by trying to rewrite what i write neater or type it  i guess they are both valid or it's hard to type as fast as i think why i write on paper what i this but then even i can't read what i write half the time    on a more petty note i am worried about math i just have no idea what to expect but that is something that i can put to the back o my mind   i'm trying not to think of anything school related because i want to write on that next time but some overlapping is probably ok i'm worried about math because i don't know what to expect that is the difference between high school and college in high school you could mess up on the first quiz or test and not worry about it because you had twenty more grades to bring it back up in college if you misjudge the teacher and screw up on the first test it will be very hard to bring the grade back up for the semester it would be like taking an entire six-weeks in high school to learn how a teacher gives tests  oh well   ,1
"well, my first thought is that i don't quite understand this activity. i'm not sure if you want me to tell you my thoughts, as in a journal, or just irrevelant thoughts that pop into my head as i type, therefore i'll just write a journal entry. well, right now i'm mad at my friend because she seems to be choosing her boyfriend over me to hang out with, so i guess that would make me jealous. and it doesn't help the fact that she and her boyfriend are the only two people at ut that i know. another feeling that i'm experiencing is sadness and homesickness. i just talked to my best friend, who is attending the university of north texas, and she was describing to me how much fun she is having and how many friends she is making-this makes me sad because i know that she is having more fun than i am. i think jealousy has a little to do with that also. i talk to my parents almost every day, and they describe their everyday life to me, and i feel left out almost, because i can't be there with them. i miss the normalcy of home. i miss waking up in the morning and knowing who my friends are, and what to expect in my classes. i know that things will change, i'm just really anxious for that to happen. sometimes i doubt if i made the right decision by coming to ut. would things be different if i were at unt with my best friend?  i know things would be better. i was always afraid that if i went to unt, my best friend would think that i was going there only because i couldn't make friends anywhere else. i only decided to come here to ut because they have an outstanding business department, and i plan to major in management information systems(mis). i'm a little overwhelmed right now because it seems like there is so much to do. in every single class so much is expected of you. it will just take a little time to get used to everything. i don't adapt well to change-i'm very much a habitual person.

"i love this song. it reminds me of plano, and when i hung out with my old friends. i wonder where they're at right now?  i wonder if they're ok, and if they're doing well at college. where's my roommate. he should be back by now. he must be eating. i wonder why this c. d. keeps skipping, i know it's not scratched. i can't wait till tonight. i can't forget about my laundry in twenty minutes. it better still be there when i go for it, or somebody's losing a leg. actually, i trust most everyone on this floor because they're all pretty cool and i've met most all of them. the guy down the hall, he's pretty cool, he just isn't used to texas life. the heat yes, since he's from hawaii, but the people no. should i rush a frat, or not. there are many great advantages to this, but i really don't want to join a bunch of guys i don't know and find out they're a bunch of losers, or drugees. i guess i'll never know until i decide to join, it's just whether or not i think they're cool. a lot, if not all of my friends, have joined a frat, so i can find out who likes their frat, and who doesn't to figure out which one i'd like to rush or pledge. i'm actually rushing them all, because there is no reason not to. my sister will give me the drop since she went here not to long ago. i'll ask here and get here to help me out because a lot of her friends are alumni's of the better frats. this part of the song is the best. it always makes me feel so happy, like i could do anything. wait one sec, i have to sing along. dangit, when is susan going to call back, there are so many plano people here in austin i feel like i'm at high school all over again, just a bigger neighborhood to party in. i don't like driving here to much because there are no medians, and the speed limits aren't posted anywhere. i'm not used to having to drive sooo aggressively here. i mean i always drive aggressively, but i wonder if people here take offensive driving, instead of defensive driving. now it is time for me to go take a safe walk, since my car is so dang far away.

"today has been one of the longest days of my life. i have had only one class today so i am constantly looking for some way to spend my time. it seems that everyone i know here on campus is in class or at work, therefore i am left alone with nothing to do. when i sit there with nothing to do i become very homesick. if it were not for my friday classes i would be long gone. it excites me however, that tomorrow i get to go home. i can't wait to be in my own house without a roommate or doors slamming through the night. one thing that i can't wait to see is my cousins. they are adorable. the oldest, sydney, is like the sister i never had despite the fact that she is only nine years old. i enjoy being around her and it makes me proud when she comes to me to ask personal questions. i have three other cousins too. leizl, who is five, is so cute and has such a wild imagination. it excites me to watch her imagination at work. she is one of the very few children left in this world that can entertain herself for hours with a paper towel roll. next is will, the little man. he is only two and is constantly making me laugh. he is in love with blues clues and power puff girls. he knows every word to the songs and has his own little dance for each of them too. the youngest, and i have to say my favorite, is little miss annie makenna. she turned one on august 30. the reason that i think i like her the most or think about her the most is the fact that we almost lost her. she was born with the strep virus in her lungs and spent the first month of her life in the icu on a lung machine. she is now a healthy little girl. she is now walking but it seems so weird to see her walk because she is only the size of a 6 month old. she is so tiny. i can't wait to see them. they are the world to me and i love them and miss them everyday. just as i do my parents and my brother. that is on thing that gets me down about college. i don't like being away from my family. i love them dearly. they mean everything to me. writing this paper has depressed me but i know that tomorrow i will get to see them all and spend the entire weekend with them. yeah! my brother is cool. i am one of the very few girls in this world that got blessed with an awesome older brother. he is three years older than me and he has always been there for me, much like my two loving parents. i thank god everyday for the family that he has given me and the support he has surrounded me with.

"i'm wondering just what the point of this is. this is really boring,       i wish i had something to eat, it's getting close to dinner time, maybe      if i turn on the stereo this won't be so bad. it's really hot in my dorm room, this is still as boring as ever. i don't know how i'm going to     be able to keep this up for twenty minutes. i can't help but stare at the     posters to kill time. i'm particularly fond the print of monet's sunset at venice. there are so many things i'd rather be doing right now, like watching tv or sleeping. well i'd much rather this have been a 5 minute stream of consciousness writing, since 6 minutes has lapsed. i wonder     just how many of these the professor'ta's actually read. i know i wouldn't want to have to read any of these. hopefully i did well on my biology test i took today. tomorrow is my birthday and hopefully that will be cool. i still have a lot of reading to do tonight, which i will more than likely put off until sunday. only ten minutes has gone by so far. this is incredibly boring, but at least it's not all that difficult. i thought last class's discussion was very interesting, however gruesome some of the experiments on the mice seemed. i can hear people talking out side. normally i would find this disruptive, but now it's welcomed as it helps me think of more to write about. i wish i had a laptop so that i could type this elsewhere, and i think the heat from my computer contributes to my room's excessively high temperature. i wish i could go to the game saturday, but i didn't get a ticket. last week's game was really exciting. only one more minute. i just wish this were over with. i can't help but notice how disorganized my desk is, even this early in the school year. i can hear music playing in the next room. i wish my stereo system was that loud.

"ok rigt now iam a little unsure of what exactly i should be writing. i am trying to concentrate on this assignment while my roomate is getting ready to leave. the only thing i can hear is the soungd of her opening drawers, people talking in the hall, and the refridgerator sound. before i started writting this i just finished my last class of the week and now it is offically the weekend. suddenly i feel the stress of the week almost evaporating from me. even though i know the weekend will be packed and probably just as stressful it seems easier. right now my room is very cold. after i finish this assignment i will be packing for a retreat and calling my parents to speak to them before i leave. the fact that i will be on lake travis all day tomarrow excites me. austin is georgous and i can't wait to see the lake. my roomate just left the room. she went to play racketball with her friends. my roomate and i get along very well and for that i am very grateful. it would be hard to live the whole year with someone you did not like. i actually like my whole hall i live in jester east on the 9th floor. the girls in my hall are all fun and we seem to hang out with each other. eww i hope casey locked the door when she left because a stocker has been spotted on my floor. i've talked to a few girl who said they have had encounters with him. they said he knocked on their door and asked if he could hang out with them while he waites on his friend. there are pictures up on the walls of him everywhere saying to not approach him if they see him. last night the police were outside of our dorm and i think it was because of him. my hand is starting to hurt. yesterday i feel flat on my face and scraped up my hand. it was actually kind of funny. my friend and i were racing to get in line for ou tickets and i triped and slid to the ground with only my hands stopping my face from hitting it. everyone standing in line saw me. yesterday was also my brother's birthday. he turned 20! -which seems crazy to me. 20 seems so much older than 19. it's crazy how time flies so fast. i can remember when me and my brother were young and just played all day. i wish i could have seen him yesterday but i had class and he's at southwest. since were only 30 minutes away it seems like we've grown closer.

"such a new, big place to be. so many people to meet and things to do. i  hope it all turns out alright. this is such an important time in my life. hopefully i will do well in school and also have a tremendous amount of fun. i have already met so many people that i can't even remember all their names. this is such a confusing time for me. trying to settle on a new group of friends  and trying to fit in. because i joined a fraternity i don't think making friends  will be a big problem, but i still don't feel totally comfortable with them yet. everyone tells me that those will be my best friends four the next few years and   probably for the rest of my life and i hope they're right. i can't wait for   longhorn football season to start. i've been such a huge fan all my life and now  i am finally able to go to the games as a student. i'm trying to think of  something else to talk about. oh, i got it. my girlfriend and i just had our   one year anniversary today. i feel really bad because we could not really go out. i did bring her breakfast in bed though. she gave me the most amazing present i   have ever gotten. it was a book she put together of pictures and other things   that we have done together over the past year. i almost cried because she put   so much time effort and love into it. i just glanced at my clock and i only  have a few more minutes to keep on writing. i'll finish up by talking about  school. i hope i start off my college career off with a good semester and then  keep it going throughout my college career. that would then lead to many good  career opportunities and a happy, successful life.

"     let's see. i love him? maybe. he told me he loved me, well, that he liked falling in love with me. wow. this is new. i love being held by him. i miss him when i'm not with him. i think about him when we're not together. i don't know what to tell him. nothing needs to be said though. we like each other. love may come, develop, whatever. it's a good feeling to know that you are loved, not having family and old friends nearby. he makes me feel like i am at home. now that i do have a new home, up in oklahoma. speaking of which, he said he wanted to come with me when i go up. wonder what the parents will say??? oh well, nich likes him and i know they will too. he's hard not to like. so busy, not enough time. should i stay home this weekend to spend more time with him or is that trying too hard? what's trying to hard though, if my feelings are this strong then it shouldn't matter whether or not i try to be with him. obviously he has the same feelings, he only called me every day like five times in the past couple days since he has been busy with his fraternity business. ahh, the good old fraternities. i wish i would have rushed, but then again i am glad i didn't. there is always next year. wonder if it is more difficult to get in as a sophomore?? we shall see. i mean, i don't think greek life is that important. but aparently to some it is. i guess i need to make more friends that are girls. i really do want to become more involved as well. it's just the whole rushing process that i wouldn't like. the getting all dressed up and basically trying to impress some girls. not to mention the fact it seems like competition. one of my not-so-favorite things. i don't really understand it all. i just couldn't be fake like i know some girls are. why bother? i mean, be who you are if they don't like that, then what on earth are you doing? there's no reason for them not to like me. i can't decide whether it's an acceptance thing or not. i don't think i am scared of being rejected. sure in a sense i am. but i think i would take it better if others didn't have to know. i like the perks with a sorority, they seem fun. a lot of time commitment though. i guess i just think that i would see him more often if i were in a sorority, if not that, then i would be just as busy as he is. i mean, i have lots to do now, probably should be doing even more. but still. it's different. poor erik, i wonder if he is still bitter towards his parents about not letting him pledge. it suprised me when my mom said they would pay for it. does she realize the cost? i know she really wants me to get involved as well though. well, i guess i can just ask casey and lauren and other girls how it is. that is if they can say. blah blah blah. nothing on my mind. oh i wonder if lk got the tickets to the live concert. i want to go. but it's such a hassle to drive to katy and back. plus i would probably miss a few classes. let's see, that friday is my homecoming. haha. won't that be great. very unusual for sure, but it will be fun to see everyone. i wonder if they have changed. i know i have. i mean, i haven't seen these people since may. coming here over the summer was one of the most life-changing experiences. strange enough to say, it is very true. i met so many good friends. i met my baby, who. i love. . yeah about that. we've been   together   for sometime now and he is seeming to settle more or less. which i might add, i thought could never happen. ok, but hold on, we're like 18, no settling allowed. yeah he asked if i would marry him. that was funny, jokingly, luckily. haha. no, funny thought to think about though. marriage. ahh. i really can't wait, no can wait, but i look forward (much better wording) to having a family. i want a happy family and a loving father' husband. wow, i wonder what guys think about this stuff. i never used to even care about family and husband and future stuff. but since he came along and we've been together. it just makes ya think. good thoughts, nothing too serious. man i love him though. i hope he knows.

"there is this really annoying beep that will not stop, and at the moment it is the center of my attention, my focus. i cannot think of anything else because now that i have acknowledged this repetitive sound i cannot get it out of my head. it seems as though it is getting louder. i also hear the flopping of someone's shoes as they get closer, oh, and another person. each of them into their own schedule, their own life. wow, shoes all have such a distinct sound. someone just walked by with shoes that have a very hard sole and make a loud rough sound. the beeping continues. a girl nearby is getting a drink from a machine. i bet she's thirsty. i'm thirsty actually. i'm hungry, too. someone else just walked in the nearby door and a bell just rang. i hear some more clank of change and that sound of a drink coming down the machine to yet another thirsty person. as he came around the corner he was the same guy who just walked in the door but just left out the same door. i wonder where he is going, if he's a student. what kind of life he has, his interests everything that makes him an individual. more squeaky shoes. i seem to be hearing all of the shoe noises possible, as well as that beeping that still lingers in my ear. everyone has different ears. people are so different. i love ut because there are so many unique people, and a lot of them are very friendly. something just changed in the overall sound the air conditioner went off or some other constant light sound ceased, for it now seems much more quiet. i hear a man's voice in the nearby classroom who is talking about parabolas. oh, how i don't like math. it's like a different language to me, and it scares me to think of some of the classes i might take. the ringing continues. a man walked by talking to himself. i wonder if he realized he was talking to himself, or if it's just one of those things that people do naturally and then when you ask them about it they can't believe they do whatever that thing is. the ring seems longer as it still persists the intervals between them are about 5 seconds. it's thundering. it's sprinkling outside but it's sunny i'm waiting for it to stop so i can walk back to my dorm. i could just walk now but i am content just sitting here. the chair is comfortable. it's almost like a couch, and the cushioned back feels nice. now the coke machine in front of me started making that same noise again which stopped few minutes ago, aahh. i still hear the ringing. what is that? and the man's voice in the classroom. i can't make out what he's saying because of the other little noises. more people around the corner. my finger kind of hurts from writing so fast without stopping. i wonder how many muscles are working right now in my hand allowing me to write? again, another girl's shoes flop against the floor. the floor is orange tile and not a bright orange kind of burnt, how ironic? another guy walks by i wonder, too, where he is going. is he married? more clanking of change and ringing, but there is now nobody in the hall. chalk writing on the board it's an interesting sound. i'm thirsty. i'd like an orange juice.

" i just walked in my room from going out and it seems the ac is not working. the room feels stiff with warm air that has been dormant for days. the smell of warn-off room freshener and paint enraptures me as i look in perplexity at the clothes thrown carelessly on the floor. two canvases lay on the stained carpet. the idea was to paint each one different, but to have the same motif. it was harder to come up with an idea than i thought it would be. that was a few hours ago, which was before i had a glass of the   fratty   punch.      it's so silly, how these fraternities make punch with around seventy-five percent alcohol. what are they trying to do to us? women are not primitive. we understand what they have in mind. see, if it was up to the guys, they would drink heavy beer from noon until dawn. but it is the punch that us ladies enjoy, and that is clear enough evidence for the boys to work vigerously weekly on the near-poisenous beverages that they supply.      as i stood there earlier on the lawn in front of the frat boys' house, i suddenly asked myself a question.  do these boys really want to talk to me?   i wondered.  and if they do. why?        two things quickly were brought to my attention. one was the fact that if they did want to talk to me it was because they either liked my company, or that they liked the way they visioned me without my outfit on, one which by the way took me 35 minutes to pick out. how ironic huh?! the other was the fact that if they didn't desire to converse with me, that they had enough respect for me to actually return the small talk, and even at times initiate the redundant aquaintance talk so often practiced at frat parties.     it was then that i realized that either way, they were talking to me, and i got to talk to them just long enough to smell their woodsy cologne, as well as to look into their dreamy eyes!      those stupid frat boys. man are they dumb, but they sure are entertaining!!!

"this computer lab, jester east, is rather warm. it's stuffy in here. that isn't however a bad thing, considering how sick i am. actually, i'm feeling a whole lot better now, as opposed to this morning. i wonder if i missed out on anything important in linguistics. i doubt i missed out on much. oh well. i'm relieved about the calculator issue regarding chemistry. i'm glad i know someone who has a car (means of transportation other than the bus). if i keep shopping i may soon find myself in need of help from my parents, financially. then again, i am buying necessities: food, soap, water, dayquill, nightquill, etc. my nose is cleared up. that's something to be happy about. ah. i can't help but smile at the fact that he came over and simply spent time with me today. he basically just watched me sleep, sniffle, and cough. he's so sweet. i kind of don't want to go home this weekend because of him. he's gone out of town the last two weekends, and now i'm going out of town. hmm. i don't leave until friday night. i guess i should try to get a hold of my parents. they may be interested in my visit. shoot! only twelve minutes have passed. i feel like i've been typing for a much longer time period. uhoh, my nose is causing me to sniffle. ugh. it's so annoying. good thing i brought kleenex with me. my mouth is dry. and my tongue hurts from chewing gum. i'm not use to chewing gum, at least not as much as i have been lately. i'm self conscious about my breath, since i have a sore throat. as a result i'm constantly chewing on cinnamon flavored gum. in a way, this isn't exactly my train of thought, at least not the uninterrupted form. i find myself with the need to explain, or give a bit of background info to the reader, if there even is indeed a reader. ah well. just three more minutes to go. i can't wait to get back up to my cold room, pop open a can of ginger ale and chug. i've successfully made mouth feel even more dry. my throat is starting to hurt again, but only when i swallow. one more minute left. perhaps i'll just type my abc's while i wait for that one minute to pass. ooh. well aren't i little miss creative. okay time's officially up!.

"as i sit here and complete this assignment, i am reminded of all the other homework assignments i have been bombarded with this labor day weekend. much of it is reading, and i know how important it is to keep up with it. i have learned many lessons from procrastinating. i keep thinking how this weekend is flying by too quickly. i am currently enjoying my short stay here back at home. i feel as if that in the blink of an eye, i will be back at college. when i returned home on friday, i went to my brother's high school football game. just being in that atmosphere brought back all the feelings of high school. some were good and some bad, but i will always treasure the memories of going to those games and having the time of my life with my friends. my birthday is next monday on the thirteenth, and it will definitely not be the same without all of my close high school friends. i cannot believe my birthday this year has to be on the worst day of the week. i will probably celebrate it with my family next weekend. my feet are freezing right now. i need to put some warm slippers on. since i am writing this assignment on paper first, my hand is beginning to cramp up. however, i am beginning to think of how much i am truly enjoying this assignment. i like the way i can just freely express myself without any impediments to cease me. i feel a bit hungry because i have not eaten breakfast yet, and it is nearly lunch time. i have a familiar craving for fruit. my mom has read my mind and has just brought a bowl of grapes over to me. the taste of cold, plump, luscious grapes satisfies my momentary craving. i need to go running today because i did not eat very healthy yesterday, and i feel fat. i wonder if it has been twenty minutes yet. i think so. i better stop before i babble on forever and ever about the most randomest things.

"i have too much homework to do. it is really different from high school where you could finish your homework in a couple of hours. the homework in ut requires you to read a whole lot and complete an enormous amount of homework in a short amount of time. also, at ut, you must manage your time wisely becuase you are on your own and there is no one to bug you are pester you about your time management. also, there are a lot of distractions like girls, basketball, sleep, etc. going to early classes has been hard for me so far. it is really hard to stay awake for the 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock classes becuase some are just too boring because of boring professors that like to lecture over meaningless material because no one understands it. i think that if they should teach like they did in high school where they show examples of the things that they are talking about, or go at a slower pace so everyone can understand. this is because once you are lost, you really don't want to have to work really hard to get back up to speed. i really think that my gpa is important this semester becuase i am trying to transfer into the business school and out of the college of natural science. this is becuase i do not like computer science which is my current major, and business seems easier and a better track to go. today in psychology class we learned an intereting lesson on lie detection. it kind of lost its point since the professor could not tell what the student's number really was. i want my parents to bring me a bike to ut. it is because the campus is just too big and it is too hot to walk to all of my classes. but i kind of don't want a bike on one hand because it will mess up my hair, you will have to pedal over hills, and cars don't really care about bikers as much as pedestrians. i am kind of pissed that the school is closing gregory gym tomorrow because they are throwing the plaza party. i think that they should have it somewhere else because a lot of people like myself like to play basketball there at night. plus it is already too congested at night because they hold volleyball games on other courts during the night too. i really think that the ut football team is going to do well this year. although they blew a big first game, i think that they have a chance to do something either this year or next year. i don't understand why chris simms chose to come to texas over tennessee. he is such a good quarterback to be a backup. i think he should be starting over major applewhite even though he lacks experience because he has a good arm and he is more atheletic. i really don't like to do these things because it takes so much time. when i first started typing i didn't realize how long 20 minutes is, but it is a long time. when i finish this, i need to start on my english paper, and do my calculus problems. my calculus ta is really stupid because she cannot teach us. she skips too many steps, and she can't explain problems very well. i think that radio stations should not have morning shows. this is because i was listening to a radio station in the morning that didn't use to have a morning show because they were new, but now they have one and it sucks because they play so much less music. also, they always talk about really corny stuff that no one wants to pay attention to. i like it when it rains. but here in austin is never seems to rain. i've been here for 2 1'2 weeks now and not a drop of rain. when it rains i feel better for some reason. tomorrow is probably my best day of classes because i don't have to wake up until 12 in the afternoon. and all my classes are basically the discussion groups where you don't learn anything. i like a girl here are ut but i don't know if she likes me back. but i am also faced with the dilema of liking another girl that goes to emory in atlanta. the girl that i like in ut though does send me any signals that she likes me or even agknowledges that i am there. she also hangs around a lot of other guys that makes me pretty jealous. the girl in emory is a girl that i've known for 4 years and i think i stand a better chance with her, but i hear that long distance realtionships never work out.

"right now i am in my friend's jester dorm to do my writing 1 with her computer. i will probably do all my writing assignments in her room because all the other computer labs in the u. t. campus are always full. it is really annoying when i have to wait to use a computer. i just don't have time to wait, since i have so much homework to do. i feel very nervous and uneasy about all my classes because this is my first year in college. people told me that the method of studying in college is different from high school. i am still not use to living in the dorm. it is too small and just doesn't feel as comfortable as home. i miss my parents, my dog, and the freedom to drive my car out. i am going to work very hard in college in order to have a very successful life. my leg and arm muscles are aching, since i played basketball and worked out at the rec center yesterday. i like the facility there. there is a good variety of things to do. i plan to reserve time everyday to play sports, especially basketball and tennis. the boyz ii men new song called """"the four seasons"""" is in my head right now. i enjoy listening to the song. it sounds very sweet and peaceful. the song reminds me of the time when my mom and dad send me off to here at u. t. i am now listening to the movie called """"space jam. """" my sister and my friend are in the room watching the movie. i saw the movie about half a year ago. i thought it was a very cute movie. it is amazing how the creators of the movie can mix animation with real people. my favorite basketball player, michael jordan, is one of the main characters in the movie. i like to watch him play basketball because he always makes incredible shots. it is so cool when michael makes a slam dunk. he really does fly a little. i hope tomorrow will be a good day for me. i hope i won't be very nervous when i go into my classes. i have four classes to go to tomorrow! i am really excited about seeing my senior u. t. cousin tomorrow!

"i like this writing assignment. it seems easy. i know i'm doing this pretty early, but it's okay. i don't want to go to class tomorrow. my roommate is playing his music pretty loudly but i don't care because i do the same thing. i wonder if i set my alarm clock. 8:30 is way too early for me. i sure do type slowly. i can still hear my roommate's music. i need to pee, but i can't. i have to wait 20 minutes. this is getting boring. i'm not very thoughtful today. maybe it's because i am tired. i may go to sleep early today, but i know i won't. i am so glad that i only have two classes tomorrow. my roommate is talking on the phone again. i'm very delighted that i got a cool roommate. man, only seven minutes passed. i'm getting so tired and bored. my roommate just left. he sure does go out a lot. i hope he doesn't wake me up tomorrow morning. home. i miss my house, my turtles, my mom, my dad, and my friends. i sure do have lots of electronics in my dorm. i wonder why dogs howl at the moon. man that was sure random. my keyboard is pretty cool. i still need to pee. gosh only ten more minutes to go. i am halfway there. my shoulder is starting to hurt. i wonder how many words i can type a minute. gosh, i'm glad that i am using word. i cannot spell today. i still need to get my course packet. i'll probably go tomorrow. this is weird. i feel like i am talking to myself, but it is kind of cool. i wonder how people just came up with computers. i am sure glad that i am living in a society with ac. i would so be sweating everyday. it's so hot here, but not as humid as houston, that is a plus. i wonder if i am supposed to be writing sentences or not. oh well, i only have five more minutes to go. i don't watch television as much as i used to. i need to start watching the news. i never know what's going on in the world. i don't even know the names of the presidential candidates' running mates. gosh, i wonder how many words i have typed so far. this page is filling up. there are only three more minutes to go. then i get to send this in. i wonder if you are going to read this. i need to stop my online slang for writing. my chair sounds like a fart when i move it. oh oh, two more minutes, and then i'm done. that pretesting sure took a long time to fill out. one more minute left. man, i lost my thought. i wonder how many seconds are left. my stomach is starting to make noises. there sure are a lot of underlinings in this paper. woohoo, all done.

"wow, i really don't feel like typing for 20 minutes, especially because i can't type all that well. my foot really itches. it is so hot in here, my roommates keep the air up way to high. my hands are sweating, and it takes a lot fir me to sweat. i feel terrible. i really hope that i'm not getting sick. my nose really itches. bad! sniffle. i really miss thomas. i wish he were here right now. now my elbow itches. and my nose again. this commercial is so gross. i would run the other direction too. my legs are sweaty too. i wonder if the sweat will mess up my keyboard. i wonder where ky is. gahh i really hope he doesn't like me. he is cool but i just don't want to go past friendship. my eyebrow itches too. man, stuff really itches when you are paying attention to yourself. my shoulder and nose both do. i have a lot of knots in my shoulders too. maybe thomas will i have me a massage when i go home this weekend. that hair is on my nerves. i have so much reading to do, i don't think i will ever get caught up. i am really worried about kim. i hope she can get everything figured out money wise and also with her math. i don't know what i would do if she weren't here. man my hands are sweaty, it is so hot in here. i wonder what thomas is doing. he is having that dumb study group at his house tonight so i probably won't be able to talk to him that much. i love him. i wish he would be able to come here and visit. his parents would never let that happen. he is coming to the nebraska game so maybe him and his dad can come see my place. my arm itches. now the other one does, and my shoulder. i have a lot of knots. it felt great for them to be rubbed. my nose itches. i am so stopped up. there comes the air, maybe it will cool off. kari must keep her air on like 80. i cannot type at all! my legs are stuck to this leather couch. i really need to go to kim's to use her nair. my foot itches. i really need to go work out. i cannot gain weight this year. i need to shave too. i have so much that i need to do, but there's no way i can do it all. my hands are still sweating, but it feels better now that the air came on. only 3 more minutes. this sweat better not mess up my computer. there goes jayme's alarm. my eye itches but i can't scratch it because of my make-up. i have to change the tv. felicity just gets on my nerves. my ear itches. and my thigh. and my other ear. and my eye. wow! oooh friends is on. but so is trading spaces. i love that show. genevieve really gets on my nerves. oh this is the kids version ugh i sneezed. i guess i will watch friends now. oh my 20 minutes is up! yay i can stop     ",1
"like how my day was, yeah, i woke up real early today, likie 800 and theres still ab unch of people walking in and out of my room like this one girl who likes my roommate, and i know i left my last topic right in the middle but illcome back, so anyway, this girl that just walked into my room like my oommate, and she seems really nice, and shes cute enough, but someone told my roommate that shes not cute and now he doesn't like her, now i must concede that in the past, i've realized that girls aren't as beautiful as i originally thought, bcause someone else told me they didn't think so and i relized id been projectin something on the girl, or looking a little too hard for something that's not there, so i shouldn't judge or somethinng like that and and so i woke up for an 830 class this morning, and it was a cal stuy session that was completely pointless, i miss my high school calculus class, i miss my high school cal teacher, she was a very good teacher, i ad lot of those in high school, so i guess i'm pretty lucky, but she was a really good teacher, and a lot of my friends in the class got together ad had a great study group, because, well for many reasons, first of all they werent my best friends, thy were three girls and my brohter, but they werent my best friends, and so i didn't have to worry too much about getting too off topic at the biegginning of the year with stupid inside jokes, we could just study, and later onwhen we became better friends, we could talk for hours about iomportant stuff, or reminice, and still know when to crachk down and actually study, also like i said the teacher was just great, i'm going back this weekend and since its labor day we don't have school on monday so i may just skip school tuesday and stay home to  go back and visit some of my old teachers, and i've only got 6 more minutes of writing, but i really think thatd be nice, uhh i'm out of tuff to say again, and everyone is babbling in the background, and i'm trying to tune him out, or them out, but now i'm losing total train of thought and so i'm going to start babbling again or risk having to stop all together and so i don't have any more classes today and i'm struggling here and my roommates playing playstation, so i went and worked out the other day, actually yesterday, and it was the first time in 4 months, but i'm going running and weight liftin again today, and i havent run in about the same length of time and so i'm sorta worried about taht, but i'm looking forward to it to, getting a little chubby you know, so i'm starting to work out 6 days a week, about one to two hours a day, and i'm worried is going to but a strain on my homework, but i've always been able to to manage time in the past and i just noticed that i've got less than aminute and now i'm done so i'm wrapping up saying goodbye if you ever read this, i ope you enjoyed this little window into my head ",1
"i have a headache i took some excederine a few minutes ago i am tired. after four days off i was out of the habit of going to school. i feels good to be home. this assignment is odd. i am full. my head is hurting again with a dull pain this time. tuesday night, nothing good comes on tv  i have to watch satellite shows. some people did this assignment in the first day of class. i guess it is hard to find anything to do when you move away from home  i am glad i decided to live at home, but i am afraid i am missing out on meeting new friends. sometines i feel like an outsider on campus. but i wouldn't have made friends easily either. i would just sit around, study and be bored. i wish i was more outgoing. i want to speak to people and make new friends but it is one of the hardest things to do speaking to strangers. i want to but my own inhibition stops me. it is funny how you can want very badly to do something but someting inside you stops you from doing it  this is really helping my typing. like in high school typing class  high school was generally a good time  i had trouble meeting people there also. i was time to graduate, more would have been ridiculus. i waited until people would make an effort to meet me rather than be proactive  i should approach people myself like i intended to do today but couldnt  ut is a big place  i have a lot of concerns  i like chemistry and welch hall but i am a business major  business majors earn more money  i want to buy a house and a new car on my own break away rom my parents  but i am not ready to leave home. starting high school depressed me  i am afraid i will hate business  i think god's plan was for me to be a scientist but i am taking all the wrong courses  common sense tellw me to major in business but my gut feeling is science  there are no easy answers  i can be a judge, which is cool  i don't think i think fast enough on my feet to be a lawyer  drafting documents i can do  a masters in business would provide as many opportunities a law school but with law i get a license and a doctors degree. is prestige that important. sometimes lawyers carry a stigma  i don't want to seem overeducated to work in business, but its now or never. it is too hard to decide what to do in life  i am afraid i am making all the wrong decisions. time is up i like this assigment ",0
"i am worried about how i can save my $30 until the end of september. i need to buy 2 books and groceries and personal stuff. i am thinking that i need to find a part time job somewhere on-campus very soon. i also feel guilty about not going home to my family over labor day. i know i should visit them but every time i spend long periods of time with them ie. days, they really start to piss me off and then i get into a bad mood. so instead of going to visit them over labor day i think i am going with some friends to visit some friends in houston. i miss my friends back home. this school is really big and sometimes i feel all alone. my classes are starting to stress me out, especially my rhetoric and composition class. i cannot write very well so i probably won't do well in that class. i feel like i'm writing in a diary which is wierd because i've never kept a diary contains all my thoughts and feelings. when i was little and had a diary i just wrote what i ate for lunch and who i sat and played with at reces or who i had a crush on. i just found a bobby pin in my hair from last night. that's kind of embarrassing, i hope no one saw it. i'm supposed to keep writing for ten more minutes but i don't really know what else to write. i have to e-mail my mom, cousin and some friends later. i hope my friend doesn't have to go to jail. no one has heard about his trial that was the other day. maybe i'll call them later on and find out what happenned. i am so hungry. i can't wait for lunch. i son't know why i've been getting cravings for salty foods because usualy i would always look for ice cream, but lately i've had cravings for chex mix, pizza, chips and stuff like that. i hope i filled out the right pre-testing survey for psychology because i saw a button you click on in this web page, but this isn't the one that i went to. i forgot to bring a pencil with me. i wonder what my ex-boyfriend is doing now. i still miss him even though he was a big jerk and i really don't want to get back with him. i think people will always have feelings for their ex'es even long after they've broken up. i miss my sister too. we never really got along until about 3 or 4 months ago. i feel bad about never really being a nice sister. i always teased her and i knew it hurt sometimes. i wrote her a letter before i went to  college. i hope she's read it. i think i've been writing for 20 minutes but i'm not sure so i'll keep writing for two more minutes. hmm. well this kind of makes me feel better to let all of my thoughts out instead of keeping most of them inside my head.

"twenty minutes seems long, i wonder what the footbal game will be like. i miss my best friend. i'm glad to be going home next weekend. my own bed. it is lonely when no one is around me. wonder what my roomate is doing? why is my floor so quiet right now? i'm glad i don't want to be around anyone right now. i hope clubbing is fun tonight because i do not want to spend my entire year just sitting in jester. wonder if i'll transfer next year? i hope i get into the busines school, but at the same time if i don't i have an excuse to leave texas. i miss connecticut. autum wil come soon, why are there no decent trees in texas? i hate the heat and the desert and the southern accents. i just want to be back in my comfortable bed in connecticut not in plano texas. i know i must be upset because i could barely eat at lunch. why has no one called me today? i call people every day and leave messages, even my parents have more of a life right now. oh, this is my favorite part of this song. i am gald i decided to put on dave matthews while i did this. i wonder if my cats miss me? i bet they miss onnecticut too. i hope i meet some hot guys tonight, that are actually interested in me for once. i hope that my new found friends aren't too good at dancing because i suck and i don't want to look like this awkward fool with my friends dancing amazingly. i am praying that i don't end up grinding with some sketchy boy like last time with out even knowing it. i do not want to feel the penis's of random guys, hey just call me old fashioned but i like to know a guys name, maybe his major. now i am getting too worried about the thing maybe i should stay at home. no, i will not do this to myself again, i can't this is completely ridiculous. just because i don't know these people too well doesn't mean that i can hide from the world. how am i going to get know these people better if i don't go and do these things. ihop was fun last night and i tought it wouldn't be. i am glad i got to sit on the end because everyone else in the middle seemed so squished. i think that i am loosing weight, i should be because i have been eationg a lot less since i have been here. no snacking for me!!! plus i walk so mcuh. that's cool no freshman 15. but i could do with out the heat. that seems like a little too much for me. it never was that hot in connecticut. okay, maybe, but i just miss it up there. all my friends, even though they are at college. i wish it was senior year again. everything was so much less complicated then. now i feel as though i will never have everything that i did there. i tried to appreciate it all when i had it, but i didn't appreciate it enough. i had so much and even though i still have the memories i miss it all so much. i know it won't be the same when i go back, but i miss the security that i felt there. i know that this is a learning and growth ex[erience but i do not want to have all this growth i happy with myself and what i was and don't want to change. maybe if i am lucky i'll be able to graduate in three years. i already have sophomore standing thanks to my wonder ful teachers. i miss mrs. jestin and even dr. dennis. why can't i just adjust and love everything? well i guess i just have to keep on doing what i am doing and that is that. all i know is that i will never forget what i left behind.

"as i am writing this, the red sox are playing the a's. i think this really may be  the year for the sox. i hope so because how cool would it be to see the """"curse of  the bambino"""" broken. their lineup is killer this year, and they are finally playing  the game the way it's supposed to be played: defense and pitching. they look like  the 1996-2001 yankees. i'm ready for a world championship for my sox. i just read an email from home, from my dad. i miss him, just having someone  around to talk to. i guess i am really lucky to have the kind of bond with my dad  that i do, most guys don't. i mean, not many people have  the kind of dad who  taught them how to play sports and things like that, but i have vivid memories of  being 8 and 9 years old and my dad throwing me passes in the parking lot at the  ferry. with football season starting, i really realize how much i miss the game. i mean,  it's been 6 years since i didn't play football during the fall, and it is kind of hitting  hard. i miss putting on the pads, taking the hits, the excitement of friday nights,  being the captain. i miss d a lot too. we had such a crazy fall last year, always  know that we should be together but never being able to get it right. i miss 8th  periods with her, driving around in my jeep and talking. i miss saturdays, the days  after games hanging out and eating hoagies, watching football with micah. i've  been gone 3 weeks, and i'm not homesick, i'm just kind of missing the crew. i miss  meghan a lot. for 4 years, she's been one of the biggest things in my life, and i  really think she is finally being able to grasp the fact that i am one of the biggest  things in her life too. which is good, because i really cannot see either of us  drifting away from the other. i hope andrew is doing ok. i'm sure he is, such a small school is good for him. he  really craves that small environment where he can stand out and garner attention  for being the """"big guy"""", the built guy. a school like this would be terrible for his  self-esteem. but oh well, whatever floats your boat, right?  i really hope micah does ok. that kid has never been in a social group or circle  that i didn't bring him into. he may really struggle with finding his niche at school. i  hope not thought, he's my best friend and i need him to be self-confident and  happy so i can stop worrying about him. i can never really tell if worrying about  people is a good thing or a waste of time. i worry so much about meghan, with her  mother walking out on her and everything. and meghan is so reclusive when it  comes to her emotions, even to me. it betrays her every once in a while thought,  when i have a beautiful, crying girl in my arms, and it's almost satisfying to see a  basic human reaction'emotion out of her. i hope d is doing ok. being the only one of us not to go to college has to take it's  toll on her. but from what she says, she is getting her act together. i just couldn't  take seeing one of my best friends throw their life away on such a worthless guy  as lee. thank god she's finally going in the right direction. maybe i won't have to  live out that diner scene in my mind and deal with a haggard friend down the road  somewhere. of course, if it was going to be anyone who did, it would be me. going away has finally moved people to express themselves, and it really does  making me feel satisfied that i am having an impact in someone's life. or, a lot of  someone's. i really don't mean that to sound arrogant, it's just that i invest so much  of myself into those people. and i really believe it has paid off. my family seems to being doing well. i'm glad. the girls will be back in school  soon, and next year maggie will be in my position. that's crazy. go sox.

"ok. so i am suppose to be writing for twenty minutes. well, this will be good typing practice. except in keyboarding class, we were told what to type. so this might be a problem. this seat is bothering me. it's hard to get comfortable in it. its really low as well. and these stupid wheels. they don't let me stay in one place. hmm. its a good thing i don't have wheels on the bottom of my chair for my desk. although i don't know how big of a problem it would be to have wheels on that chair. because in my room, i have carpet. this is a tiled floor, so that is why the chair is so rolly. when i sit on my roommate's chair, it doesn't move so much. so that must be it. it must be because of the carpet. oh, there goes my stomach. i'm hungry. but i don't want to eat till moiz calls. once moiz and omiar come over, i can order the pizza. but the problem with that, is that i am hungry now. i want to eat now. maybe something small when i get home. but knowing me, my small snack will turn into a meal. oh well. i can wait. i guess. i wonder if they think its cheap that i'm inviting them over on monday. this way i order the cheap monday madness pizza. but i guess its not really a big deal. i was going to invite them over soon. i want my computer up and running asap. i can't believe uncle hafeez gave me a nice new cpu. that is so awesome. but then again, that might lead to problems of me doing less studying, and more downloading songs online. i hope bilal and them come tomorrow. i mean, we don't want to be waiting for them every day, waiting for uncle's call to say oh, well we still couldn't book the tickets, so they will be coming tomorrow. hmm. i smell smoke. but that can't be right. who, no what idiot would be smoking in a building. well, i guess its not that much of an idiotic thing to do. i mean, lots of people do smoke, but i just wouldn't assume that they would be smoking inside a building. ohh kay. now my hands are getting tired. i don't think i was suppose to be typing nonstop for twenty minutes. was i? oh well. that's what i'm doing. haha i can't believe i was so stupid today. i have been going to urdu class at 12 for over a week. what exactly in my mind made me go to class at one. and thank goodness it was ten minutes before one. if i had gotten there right on time, i would have felt like such and idiot walking into class late. especially in a class that wasn't mine! it's a good thing i went and talked to the professor. she is awesome! i really didn't think that she would let me sign in. i came way after the bell rang! anyways, that makes two days of udru homework to do before wednesday. but then again, i have more important things to worry about besides my urdu homework. i have that stupid quiz in english tomorrow. when did all these quizzes come up. it seems like yesterday was only the first day of class. i guess summer went my pretty fast for me. wow. it really did. pakistan was awesome. i don't think i have ever had so much fun in the million times that we went there, not as much as i had this time. and saqib, rashid, and khurram. they are as cool as they have always been. i like the fact that we are all still cool. well, it took a while for us all to open up, but at least we did. and i'm upset with raza. i didn't realize till a little towards the end, that his walkman never left his ears. i don't know, does he not understand? or does he not care? because if he does not care, he shouldn't be coming. that is really bad. and think of what everyone else thought. i'm sure they minded too. ohh. a minute and a half left. weird. it does not seem like i have been typing for twenty minutes straight. i guess this wasn't so bad after all. i wonder what happens after my time is up. will i not be able to type anything else? well, i will find out in 40 seconds. now after this, i got to pick up my i'd from the business school, then. then i dunno. i could either go to the library and finish up my reading, which would be the smart thing to do, or i could go home and study"""". but that will never work. hmm, i think i just answered my own question.

"okay so i'm just going to start typing. cough cough i wonder how i got sick. did i catch something from joe because he was sick last week but maybe it was from sleeping with the fan on high. oh well i'm feeling better today than i was before. wow it hasn't even been two minutes yet. how am i going to keep thins up for twenty?  oh well at least it doesn't really matter what i type. i wish i knew how to type faster. i have to slow my brain down to get my fingers to keep up. stupid geometry book. i hope that i did my homework proofs right. thanks so much mr. knight for not making me do proofs in high school geometry. i'm really not an orange juice fan, but i have to drink it so that i can tell john that i did so he won't worry about me not getting enough vitamin c with my cold. ooh i need to plug my cell phone in i think it's about to die. i'm really glad i called mama today on the bus ride home. i miss her. i wonder what i should get her for her birthday. it seems like it was her birthday just yesterday. this year went by super fast. six minutes down fourteen to go. i'm starting to get hungry. what do i want for dinner tonight?  i kind of want to order some chicken wings but i shouldn't they're to fattening and we have tons of food here. i should make something. maybe i'll just heat up some chicken and dumplings. that would feel good on my throat. that tomato soup i had the other day was really good too, even if it was hill country fair or whatever that crazy generic heb brand is. i miss brookshire's and good old hi top brand. nobody here has even heard of brookshire's. i guess it's because their all from houston. fuck houston. houston is not texas. people who say they've been to texas but have only been to houston haven't been to texas. any way doo doo doo dooty doo. i'm seriously running out of thoughts to type. cough cough i need to go to john's to get my roubatusin. i'm fairly certain that's not how you spell that but oh well i never claimed to know how to spell anything. today i saw this girl over near the mlk statue with food in her hands holding it out to the birds and she let pigeons and grackles land on her hand and eat out of it. not only let them but wanted them to. i had to laugh because i realized that girl must not know shit about shit"""" to quote the daily show. only five more minutes woo hoo. let's see when i'm done here i should work on my spanish homework but i think instead i'll fill in my new uncalandar. i was so excited when i found it at the co-op today. i had one last year and i loved it. then i went back this year and i couldn't find them. when i saw them today i bought two in case they didn't have them again when i go to buy school supplies next august. okay two and a half more minutes. i wonder if i should stop in mid sentence when tim is up or finish my thought. did it say that in the instructions and i wasn't paying attention?  oh well i'll cross that bridge when i get there. i can't believe i forgot to print the confirmation page for my pretesting  i hope i get that credit  that was one of the most boring experiences of my life i would hate to think it was all for nothing. or naught as john would say.

"right now it is 1:40. i don't really know what to write about. but, i guess i will just go with the flow. i can't really get use to this computer, because it keeps skipping lines and messing up. i got it about one month ago. i guess that over all it is pretty nice. i am so full. i just ate breakfast , and i think that my stomache is going to explode. but that is okay. i wonder if anyone is actually going to read this. sorry, this is a bit abstract. i would hate to have to sit there and read over five hundred of these papers. wow, it has only been five minutes and i still have fifteen minutes left. i can't believe that school has only been going on for two weeks. it is weird because it seems like i have done a lot in the past two weeks. but, it seems to be going really fast. i think that my next test is next week . who said. . sorry listening to leah anrioni. most of her songs have to do with questioning god's or man's motives. it is actually interesting to just listen to the lyrics. i wonder whi write her songs. i guess i could just look at the cd, but i'm too lazy. i wdonder if i should call jr. oh, sorry that is my boyfriend. i would have to wait till i am done with this anyway. i wonder what my life would be like if i had gone out of state. a long distance relationship would not have worked. too much time away from him. and i guess too much room to doubt his'my actions. this is better, because later i can always go. when is the first test in this class? i hope that i didn't have to read anything for next time. god, i keep hitting thr caps lock. that is so annoying. i hate reading my professors book in religios studies. he probably made us get it just to increas the book sells. that woould be kinda funny if he read this. well, not really, but i would laugh about it in about a year. three more minutes. i think melissa went back to san antonio today. i don't really want seema, my room mate, to come back. she is nice , but it has been nice to not have to listen to her talk all the time. i pretty much like my space. and she talks all the time. but i am sure that there are some very annoying things about me also. hey , my time is up. later.

"     i wasn't expecting to get sick, but for some strange reason, i am sneezing,  coughing, and everything, it is crazy. i am surprising myself lately though. i  thought i would be much more home sick, but i don't know what i am missing, or if i  am missing anything at all. i know i miss work, nothing made me more happy  really. i know it wasn't fun all the time, but the people there made it worthwhile. one in particular, no two in particular both for different reasons. i wonder when life is going to get easy. i have been working hard since i was 16,  balancing a job, school, and trying to have a life. trying is the key word. sometimes i think i missed out in high school. i was never the party type, only  because my parents wouldn't let me do anything, but i understand that they just  want the  best for me and don't want me to make the same mistakes that they  made. what they don't understand is that, it is holding me back, because  eventually i may be in the same situation that they were in, and i won't know what  to do. if i were to live anywhere in the world i would live in england, surrey was  nice. london is amazing. i don't know what to say other than when i was there i  felt home, i loved it. i surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather  than drive. i enjoy taking drives though. when i was at home, i enjoyed just  grabbing my keys and going. i never had a particular destination, but my favorite  drives were at night, with the sun roof open, oh how it was so peaceful. kind of  like sailing. recently i joined the saililng club, it is nice, i wish there was more  wind my first sail, but even so it was still unbelievably calm, and placid. it was so  nice, and made time go by so fast. i feel so stupid about endochine, i can't believe  we were just talking to them and didn't know it was then, awwww. i feel so  stupid. but then again there are a lot of times i feel stupid. too many to list. i can  not wait to go to the football game. i miss band the most from high school, there  was nothing like marching into the stadium, especially this past year when the  crowd was actually happy that we were there. i honestly never thought i would  see the day that that would happen. christina aguilera's cd is very good, at least  most of it. it is kind of sad at the same time. it is surprising how cold it was this  morning, here i am dressed as if it were 98 degrees outside and it feels more like  70 unbelievable this is supposed to be texas. i am so glad my aunt and her  partner are here , even if lester isn't exactly the most honest or faithful person, it is  still nice to see linda. i love accents, i wish i had an english accent. for some  reason i especially like the way after they say something they follow it up with  mate or love. another reason i want to move to london, i love the way they talk. i  also love orlando bloom who also lives in england, he is gorgeous. but  sometimes i wonder if he, in real life is stuck up or real down to earth. that irritates  me when you see celebrities that think they can have anything they want, and the  way people gravel at their feet. they are no different from the average joe other  than they can pretend to be someone they are not and get paid for it. pretty sweet  deal actually, i wish someone would pay me to be someone else so i could live a  fairy tale. sometimes i wish life were like a movie, not like the faculty though. more like kate and leopold. mostly love stories, that would be amazing. though  at the same time it might be too predictable. one can wish though right. i wonder  what i am going to be when i grow up, i mean really grow up. i really have no  likes or dislikes, which sometimes makes me wonder, if i have a personalitly, or if i  am just here. how is it possible for people to exist anyways. i don't know if i buy  the whole evolution thing or the bible. if the bible is true then were did the  dinosaurs come from. and if  vice versa then how did the bible come about. i still  believe there is a god because i think it is important to have something to believe  in. but sometimes i think what if god wasn't real. there would be many times i  would be lost in my life in that case. for some reason. i think there is some sort of  force that looks out for people,  ",0
"right now, i'm a little worried. i just stopped talking to my friend nick on the phone and he was talking about claiming credit and what not. i hope i'm not forgetting to do something or else i'll be in trouble. that's the last thing i need right now is trouble. my dad would kill me if i did something stupid (e. g. forgetting to do something i needed to do) and was disenrolled from any of my classes, especially ones in my major. i looked over some information i had, and i really don't think that there will be a problem, but i wish nick wouldn't have mentioned anything about it. i'd much rather be surprised than to know something was coming and have nothing to do about it. it would be like a giant meteor coming to destroy the world. i would make rather just die in a giant flash of light than have to worry for weeks knowing that there was nothing i could do to stop it from happening. in deep impact the president broadcasted to the world that there was an asteroid coming on a collision course with earth, i would hate that. sure they are going to try to stop it, but i don't have that much faith in the us government to fix poverty let alone stop an asteroid from killing us all. dig a giant hole in the ground. sure, that'll work. but anyway, i hope nothing bad happens to me. this whole college thing is a new experience for me, i'm not used to taking responsibility for everything like i have to now. i'm alone up here, except for my sister not that she can do anything. if i screw up it's my fault and i have to live with my mistake. and even if i do mess up, what would happen? i'd get dropped from a few classes and i'd have to wait another semester before doing the classes that i want to get done now. it might be good in a way, i'd have an incredibly easy semester and later i would have more electives in which i could take anything i want rather than having to take chemistry or psychology. all i can really do is hope, i guess. other than the ocassional worrisome things, college is pretty nice. carothers is an awesome dorm, much better than what i expected from a dorm. i think that i might like living here next year if i don't move off campus. i'd prefer living here actually. i never was very social before in high school, but it's nice here, it's different. most people here aren't complete idiots. honors dorm and all. also people are maturing i think. there aren't as many clique-ish people here. people are more accepting of other people's views and lifestyles. it might just be that we're all in a daze from being thrown into the college and are just looking for something to hold on to, but it could be maturing. i hope it's maturing. before in high school nobody would talk to me. i think i scared them. but here it's different. here people don't seem to care. i think i have to give the whole """"god you're so hot lets be boyfriend girlfriend"""" thing a few more years, but i can live with just friends, for now. that's always bothered me though. how people, no matter how smart or mature they are, are obsessed with looks. personally, i don't want my girlfriend'fiance'wife to be gorgeous by society's definition. i feel that every woman in one way or another is beautiful, as cheesy as that may sound. i've met people that i'd like to get to know better, and they aren't model types. i've seen those types too and they don't impress me much at all. but i think the real thing that's keeping me from getting to know any of the people i'd like to know better is my shyness. i'm not used to being social, so being thrown into a dorm with so many other social people is a strange change for me. it takes some getting used to. i need to adapt i guess, become more comfortable with my surroundings and my place in the surroundings. my friend casey became engaged too. that scares me. he's 18 i think, maybe 19, probably 18. right now, i'm only 17 but i can not see myself getting engaged to be married in a year. 18 years, when the average lifespan of a person is over 70. that's 50 years, a long time to stay married. and if i do get married i never want to get a divorce. i'd rather spend another year making sure she's the one than finding out a year into our marriage when my wife might be with child or something else. maybe i'm just old fashioned, but i think that's the way it should be. but i can't tell casey that. it's his life, i've seen him and melissa together and they are a good couple, but people change you know. maybe it's just my fear of the unknown or maybe it's true, but marriage ties you down, it keeps you from changing, it's binding. i'd hate to see casey or melissa's life ruined by this. or at least i hope they don't get married until much later, and just stay engaged. maybe i care too much and maybe it's none of my business, but this is just my stream of consciousness and it doesn't matter beyond my own mind.

"i have never had an asignment like this before. it is hot in my dorm room. i always feel sweaty especially at night. it is difficult to sleep. now that we are a few weeks in to school i can feel my self getting more and more stressed out every day. the workload is quit large, and i never have enough time to do everything i need to do. actually right now i am between classes but i only have and hour to do this assignment, do some calculus, and eat lunch. i know i won't do one of those three. i probably won't eat lunch. even though i am starving. i went to today and got a wristband for the ou game. the draw for tickets is tommorrow morning so i guess i am going to miss class to stand in line. if i do that and don't get a ticket i will not be happy. i wander where my girlfiend is right now i havnt seen her at all today. we live in the same building and i still rarely see her. usually only at night, and even then we study so we don't talk much. i miss all the time we spent together when we still lived at home. we both went greek so between her sorority my fraternity and school there is maybe 30 min a day left for just talking to each other. hopefully things will get easier later on in the semester. i live at dobie so i have three roommates, and one of them is trying to teach himself the guitar. i am really sick of hearing his stupid guitar. plus he sucks at it. i just accidentally pushed the back button on my computer, and when i pushed forward what i had already typed was still here but the timer started over. i wonder if that matters. i don't have time to keep tying for another twenty minutes. i am serously considering not going to my next class. i just want to eat lunch and take a nap. i just realized something funny my next class is pyschology. oh well just because i am doing the assignment doesn't mean i have the energy to go to class. who am i kidding i am to worried about missing something important so i will go even though i am really tired. during the last lecture i fell asleep for about 10 minutes and woke up really confused. i have so much work i have to get done before friday. which wouldn't be that big of a problem but my fraternity has something going on every night this week, and since i am a pledge i am expected to be there. my time is just about up so i am going to stop typing now.

"i am supposed to write for twenty minutes while i track my thoughts. i am looking down at my watch right now to check the current time. it is 3:30, and unfortunately i have to miss my calculus discussion class at 4:30 due to a chemistry review for a test i have on thursday, the 14th. apocolyptica, a string quartet who plays music written by the rock group metallica, is actually playing on my computer while i write this. i am also ripping one of my compact discs via my computer so i can listen to it while not actually having the cd in the rom drive. sometimes i like to think about how technology has changed in the last few years. it is absolutely incredible. in junior high school, i had no idea what the internet was, nevertheless how to use it. now, i sit at my computer and i will turn in this paper simply by pasting it into a box and clicking a small button. how does the information get to the desired location? i suppose the words are somehow converted into 0s and 1s using the binary number system. still, the entire concept is simply amazing. what is in store for technology in the future? hover cars? now there is a concept. i come from houston, which is not only the most polluted city in the united states but also has a mighty big traffic problem. i think i will switch my music to beethoven. there we go. anyway, with the help of cars that """"float"""" above other vehicles, pileups would be significantly less common. however, there would probably be more accidents, for the concept of cars above a driver adds a completely new depth to driving. now instead of just having to watch in front, back, and adjacent, one would now have to be careful of who was above him. this would definitely cause some major problems. maybe hover cars are not such a good idea. the song has now switched to holst's mars. my friend cody has the score to this piece at his dorm at the university of houston because he is a music major. a bunch of my friends and i are going to see the dave matthews concert in houston in a couple of days. i have seen the dmb perform two previous times at the woodlands pavilion, and they were incredible. however, the band has not come out with an album containing new songs in quite a while. they will be coming out with a new album very soon, so i assume they will play many songs from this album in this concert coming up. well, twenty minutes has just expired, so i will sign off now.

"i'm sitting here at my boyfriend's place, and i am hungry. that's about the biggest thing on my mind right now. when i have to write my thoughts down, i just can't seem to know what i feel at that specific moment. well, i guess,  right now i can say i'm thinking more about what i am actually going to type rather than what i am feeling or what kind of emotions i possess. ok, so now my boyfriend is trying to give me ideas on what to write. i, of course, told him that i will write only what is on my mind right now (which is hunger). princess diana's death just popped into my head. i can't believe she is dead,  even though i never paid attention to her. she was just one of those people  who i thought would always be in the news until she was ancient. just a shock. the hansons are stupid. i just now saw an mtv commercial with them on it. as you can guess, i am not a big fan. i thought they were kind of cute at first,  but the more i heard their song, the more i disliked them. celine dion needs to come up with some songs of her own. she is always remaking the old ones. all i can say is that she can't sing them as good as the people who first did. i never get e-mail. i know it's my only my first week of school, but i like  to get mail. plus, e-mail is new to me. i've never had an e-mail address before. i was really uncomfortable today when my boyfriend's roommate, girlfriend, and  her friends came over. i can never seem to get comfortable around his friends. it's like they scrutinize me. i definitely do not like to be in the spotlight. well, only if it's for a good thing. like for an achievement or if i know for sure that i will not be embarrassed. otherwise, i'd rather just be apart  of the crowd or stand in the back. being uncomfortable is the worst feeling. oh, goodness!  it has been twenty minutes already. time flew by. i kind of  liked doing this. it was kind of a relief to just sit and type and not worry about sticking to a certain topic or subject.

"being a twin i always wonder if my brother thinks like i do. i don't mean like does he have the same thought i mean does he see the world in the same perspective as me. my mind like to wander and i imagine many different scenarios in my head. like where i will be in 20 years how long i will live and why people act the way they do. everyday i think of the things why people seem to not want to try and others try there hardest. then you have people who succeed no matter what and i wonder why them. then there are people who seem to go no where in life. i am not seriously making this up for the past year or so i have been trying to figure out the world. i guess since i have left home many things in my life have changed some for the good and others just different from my life at home. i also wonder in my head a lot are we all determined to do a specific job or career. i felt at one time i was determined to be an astronaut, but now i am leaning towards the media business. i would like to make a movie that answers many questions that people are struggling with mainly people that are going through changes in the life. although change is not necessarily it creates a sense in my mind at least that this could either be a bad  and good experience. i am talking about me coming to college. if this writing seems to be changing topics a lot then that is probably because that is how i think i continuously switching ideas in my mind. it is a wonder of why i have some of the thoughts i have, but we wont go into that. being my first to take psychology i wonder what the class is going to offer me, how it will help me to explore the human mind. i have also noticed that while being at college my sleep patterns have changed i stay up late get up early sleep on the weekends. since being here i have started some sort of routine as far as my day goes, but i often wonder why us as people have routine and if they are inevitably unavoidable. this summer i worked in a grocery store was it fun no not really but it gave me a perspective of how i should view the world. there would be weeks when i got up at before 5:00 am everyday i kind of got this feeling like is this what i will be doing for the rest of my life. i thought to myself therefore i will do good in college to help better the career. working forty hours a week and making about three hundred dollars i wondered a lot of times how some one lived on that and i guess they do somehow. that is why it kind of bothers me that we have some of these people blaming the economy on one person when i believe there is an overall problem in certain area. but are we certain at all what goes on.

should be careful how much i spend, what will i do when i run out, i can't keep asking my dad for money everytime i want to go out for coffee. i just talked to my friend outside she got married last weekend and i was at her wedding and her husband's best friend really liked me and now he asks about me all the time and he wants to drive down from san antonio to see me but i'm so afraid of it, because i was so attracted to him at the wedding, and i thought about him so much after that,and i kept feeling that i wanted to be with him even though i knew i shouldn't have because i have a boyfriend and i must be loyal to him so that i can allow him to trust me because he's insecure sometimes so i don't know what to do. the guy's name is nathan and he's the kind of guy i would love to have as a friend but i don't think he's going to want to settle it at that and i'm afraid that even if he did, i might want more, which would be horribble because of my boyfriend. i'm not sure about my feelings anymore, i'm so afraid that what happened with my last relationship is going to happen all over because i'm so indecisive about my feelings. now i just want to go to sleep. i'm meeting my boyfriend after i finish writing and we're going out to lunch. i'm not that hungry. i know i should watch what i eat like i used to, but i don't anymore. it's becoming bad for me, i'm not even exercising like i used to. i don't know why, i just feel so tired. i got mad at my mom this morning and i feel bad, because it's not really her fault. well maybe it is, i just don't understand why she can't seem to help me out in the morning when she sees that i'm late, why can't she make me a sandwhich so that i can eat on my way out the door, instead of leaving the house with no breakfast and starving because i don't have time to do it myself. it takes her practically no effort, i don't understand. she must think it's a matter of teaching me to do things on my own but i think that's ridiculous, i just need a little help and she wouldn't do it. i'm looking at the time on the screen and i never realized how slow time can be sometimes. this spacebar on the keyboard is really starting to piss me off, what the hell is wrong with it. i'm getting to impatient, i hate it when it sticks. some people are typing really fast, too, i wonder if they're doing the same thing i am. i can't see their screen. a girl is listening to her headphones, it's a good idea. i wonder if we're allowed to burn our own music cd's, i saw a lady doing it at the ugl library and i really want to. but i asked my older brother and he said we're not allowed because those computers are used only for the scanner. supposedly. i'm swaying my chair right now, it calms me down. i want to listen to some music, the nice relaxing kind i listen to on 95. 5, i love that station. they put old music and it's so relaxing. yesterday i was seriously thinking about wearing a scarf. oh. . no that was today, in the shower. it's starting to bother me the way men look at me, as if i'm existing merely for their viewing pleasure, it's disgusting. i've realized lately that i've become very much less concerned with displaying my feelings, for example, if i don't like someone, i can ignore them and i don't care if they notice, or if they know that i don't like them. i never used to do that, i always used to fake it. but now i don't. maybe it's rude, but i'm tired of putting up with things i don't like. i've also noticed that i'm not as open minded as i one was. time is almost up i feel better, but i wonder what i'm going to go do now. i want to lay down somewhere, close my eyes. i feel like cuddling with someone. but my boyfriend won't do it, he'd just want to make out. i don't, i just want someone to hold me. suddenly i feel like crying a little bit. i don't know what's bothering me. a girl sat next to me who looks like jennifer the si instructor. those sessions are helpful.

"well, since i don't know how to start, i'll start by talking about my weekend. i just about killed myself learning how to slalom ski. we started saturday. buck, carl, dylan, kevin, crystal, and i went to lake georgetown with my new boat. i made it my goal to learn how to slalom ski. i actually got up on one ski relatively quickly. the only problem is that it hurts when you fall. i broke my nose the first time that i fell because i kneed myself in the face. i spent the rest of the afternoon learning how to keep my balance and how to jump. the only problem with saturday is that crystal and carl got into a fight. they've been dating for a couple of weeks now. anyway, we went back to the lake sunday and i kept trying different things and now i'm pretty good on one ski. and it is a blast, i'll never go back to two skis. sunday night i played the role of mediator for everyone. i talked to crystal about carl and i talked to carl about crystal. they are trying to work things out, but it is going to be tough. then i talked to danielle about buck. danielle is one of crystal's friends that started hanging out with us. she liked buck a lot. buck wasn't sure how he felt about her at first, but he's starting to like her. right now they have bumped their relationship status to dating. this is good because they make a good couple and they make each other happy. at least as far as i can tell. but i did a lot of talking and more importantly listening sunday. i think i helped smooth everything over with them for now. carl and crystal seem to be getting along better. i missed classes monday because of injuries that i received over the weekend. i broke my nose, twisted my back and my left knee, and got a terrible case of whiplash. i couldn't even get out of bed monday morning. i'm starting to recover though. i had to go to work tuesday. i work at internet gateway in georgetown. i love working there except that i don't get paid near what i should be getting. i make $9'hr. that should be 23 times more, but i only work 2 days a week anyway. i was working full time but i decided that since i have to go to school, i should make it my top priority. i didn't want to go to college, i'm not sure that i want to now that i'm going; but i know it is for the best and it makes my mom happy. that's really the only reason i'm going is because my mom wanted me to. actually my whole family was pushing me to go. this is ok though because i know that they only want the best for me and a college education will help out tremendously later in life. especially when i start looking for a better paying job. although, college has been really fun so far. i have had my own house since this summer. buck and i are roommates and we are renting a house in georgetown. it is a lot of work, but it is worth it to say that i have my own place. buck and i met at work. his dad owns the company where i am employed and he started working there during the spring. we have gotten to be best friends and we hang out all of the time. he is a good guy. we have a lot in common too. i've been lucky in that regard. i have a lot of good friends, and several that i can depend on for anything. it is a really good feeling to know that i can trust someone like buck with my life. i've also been very lucky because my family is very close and we all can depend on each other. my stepfather bought me a truck for graduation last year. robert, my stepfather, is a great guy and my mom and him make a very good couple. well, i've put over my 20 minutes into this paper, and i have to go back to work now.

"i hope that this isn't a big deal, as i have to write for 20 minutes in a completely random manner. if i get graded on content or grammar, i'm simply done now. i've been caring a lot about my grades so far and i'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like georgetown or columbia. i actually miss nyc a lot, but its a nice change down here and i'm happy to get out of connecticut. i do miss my family a little, but i think they are doing fine and i'll be seeing them in no time. i'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in vegas come october. still can't believe we lost in the state semi's to crappy amity. that one kid was really good though. maybe playing at ut will be just as fun and we'll have success. seems like texas lacrosse is nothing to ours, but i shouldn't get cocky yet. its only a club team. nobody better come in my room even though the door is open. don't feel like being social, and its late. its annoying that dumb mark always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds. in fact, mark is annoying in general. he seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here, but he reminds me of mendelson at home so much. i don't do well with these leech people too, i wish he wouldn't follow me around. but you know what, he is a really nice kid and i feel terrible saying these things, especially in some assignment that someone is reading. at least i'm nice to him in person. waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either. ah he is awake, he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does. bah. its funny coming to college after you're used to your friends at home. i'm glad that i don't know anyone and i'm on my own. you get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well, so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit. i think i'm meeting decent people though and i only expect to meet more and more cool people. at first i was pretty skeptical about everyone, but that's just because i was missing the guys i've had a good time with for years. time to move on. plus i always said i needed to get out of little lame brookfield. zebrahead is the bomb. i don't think i ever get tired of their music. i'd like to see them in concert again sometime soon but they don't really have any dates posted. and if i do see them again, i'm going to chill towards the back and just listen. being up front was crazy, but its hard to enjoy sometimes when you have some annoying girl giving you elbows to the kidneys and her nappy sweaty weave is sticking to your clothes and skin. but hey, its the price you pay i suppose. radio 104 fest was still probably the most fun of all concerts though, hahahahh especially when we dropped that girl that was crowd surfing and kicking people in the faces on purpose and she started bleeding. its horrible i know, but its really not cool what she was doing. plus, she was not seriously injured. girls shouldn't crowd surf anyways, there are too many dirtbag guys who are just trying to crop a feel. haha like that one guy who ripped the girl's thong off. speaking of which, i need to meet some more girls here. emily has completely drained me over the past two years and i'm glad that i can finally be away from her and her attachment and be able to meet some people. i do like that one girl in astronomy, she seems pretty cool. its too bad i don't see much potential in meeting anyone on or around my floor, they are all pretty private. i don't see what tyler and jeremy and luke see in the girls upstairs too, they're just really loud and annoying, and not the most attractive of ladies either. you got to love ut, there are attractive girls everywhere. ahahah to whoever is reading this, i apologize for sounding like a complete jackass. i've talked about dropping girls on their heads, and how i think people are ugly, and how i don't think people are too cool, and how texas lacrosse isn't very good. i probably sound like one arrogant loser. i'm really not. but i do admit that i am very confident in myself, and i think that rubs off on how i express myself. actually, i'm probably just pretty arrogant. 311 is the best. again, the playlist is sidetracking my thoughts. i wish i went to see them in concert here last week, but i've seen them before and i had class early the next day. live music is the best. i think seeing stp and cake here the first night i visited put a pretty positive spin on the place for me, that was pretty tight. there's a whole lot to do here, i love it. last night at sixth street was pretty fun too even. everything just seems cool here. i'm drawing a blank here. just listening to music. maybe i should i have left it off when i started writing. yep drawing a blank again. wonder if cameron is back at his ghetto dorm yet, he is going to have to start writing this too, and i bet i'll have mine finished by the time he even gets back in his room. okay, my 20 minutes are up, and i could continue if i wanted to, but i'm pretty tired so i think it would be best for me to just hit the sack, or play counter strike.

"the jumbled mess in my head goes on and confusion takes over. sorting out feeling from feeling and sensation from sensation leaves me with a fatigue which overwhelms me with each passing day. not totally sure of where to go or what to do, i feel as if i wander aimlessly amongst all the people. things pop into my mind, and they are the importances of certain classes, such as the tests coming up, and all the studying i still need to do. i think more about this until it consumes me, and then outcomes that might not usually happen come into mind. i can't help thinking about this as i sit here, yet i feel i shouldn't think so much about it. the possibility of failure seeps into my mind, and i can see myself never forgiving me for such mistakes. my breathing gets heavy for fear of what failure's consequences may bring. like anxiety, i fear of failure, until something else wanders into my mind. as failure subsides, and my body is back to normal, the apathetic view of things set in. i start to feel lazy, and i don't want to work. i feel as if i am walking on a fine line, and a step to the right means laziness (although at the time is very tempting), just as a step to the left means productivity. the forces keeping me on this line are 1)the fear of failure which keeps me from being a sloth-like animal, and 2)the feeling that i am not being productive when i truly am. i guess it's like growing, in a sense, for the second force, that is, because when i see myself each day, i don't notice the changes that happen when comparing one's younger self to himself, now. keeping this in mind, i guess i have found another reason why not to be lazy, but it seems like i will have to have self-disipline, which in a way is like teasing one's self for as long as you have to wait for the results. maybe i'm still being a child who doesn't want to wait for his reward. i just don't know how to change myself in that direction of being so diligent even when things are not so great. i will have to learn if i want to remove myself from this line of opposing forces, and however tempting it may be to stay on this line, i will have to find the discipline within me to do such things as study, be diligent, and stay current with the right thing to do.

"i have at least forty- thousand different things i have to do and about forty thousand different things going on around me  for one, my parents are out of the country, so it makes everything that much more complicated  second, i have been so busy with my sorority pledge class that i haven't really had time to do homework. just for the record, i feel completely overwhelmed right now. anyway, i went home this weekend just for one night and although it was extremely relaxing, it turned out that it was completely pointless to go because almost my entire family is out of the country. so i go anyway and have a great time just relaxing in my empty house with my dog and the tv, but i forget to bring back with me all my toiletries and makeup  luckily enough for me one of my best friends also went home this weekend and is coming back today, so i had to arrange with her a plan to get my stuff before she leaves that was a total fiasco because as i said before my parents are out of town and the only person who has a key is my aunt but becky, my friend, doesn't have a car so its just been crazy like that  so i get everything figured out with her but meanwhile my cousin who was house-sitting my house decided to come up to austin so i gave him list of things to bring from home, but we can never find a time when both of us are free so i still haven't gotten my much needed chemistry and calculus notes from high school (or my sunglasses)  its not that big of a deal its just that i really truly need this stuff and the fact that he was so close to my dorm and we never ended seeing each other. oh well i guess he can fedex the stuff up to me  that way i'll get a package, that is really cool since i don't get any mail anymore. oh and i haven't even mentioned the fact that my computer just does not want to work. no matter how many people play around with it, it still wont work right now i'm using my roommates computer which i have to say is a lot easier to use than mine  i've had a total of i think 4 different guys in to look at my computer, two professional and two of my friends and no one can fix it. the last professional guy is sending someone else tomorrow to look at it because he's """"really good""""  at fixing this sort of problem  also he has better tools for the job. its getting really expensive to keep paying these guys to not change my computer  oh well i guess this counts as one of life's unexpected expenses  my parents always warned me about these unexpected incidents that cost a lot of money and i guess they prepared me for it i guess that's why i don't like to spend my own money by writing checks instead i prefer just to charge it to my parents i just wish they wouldn't get mad about it now i'm totally kidding  i have a monthly allowance now and i'm not used to it yet it takes time to adjust right?  overall, i am enjoying college i just have a lot on my mind and a lot to do not that that was any different in high school i was really involved in different organizations and i was in all ap classes so i did get stressed quite easily  i've been meeting a lot of new people of whom i love so far and staying friends with all of my best friends all of my friends live in my dorm so i'm really lucky to be able to experience college with them   ",1
"     it is interesting to note that when i work on something in my head, i always forget what the details were unless i write it down. one thing i do remember though, are the feelings. i feel like what i had though was a great accomplishment that should have been written down to further my learning ability, particularly in math. with this i acn create a continuation, or a stream of consciousness type format within my math knowledge. this would help me learn a lot more on my own, rather than starting over as much as i do on particular problems. the only problem is i do not know how to keep a good organized notebook, rather i havjust not done it yet. i can keep things very well organized when i want t, but finding the motivation to do this , that is a hard thing to do. i wish i could find a way to ake a lot of things easier. speaking of which, i always make things easier in math. i always say that i am so good at some things because i make those things much easier than most people make them. i do this because i am lazy. simply put, i work on something to make it easier for me in the future. ultimately i get easier work tat way, so i am a lazy, yet slightly thoughtful person. thoughtful in the way of thinking, not as in the consideration of others. well my roommate walked in the room, so my stream of consciousness is screwed. so hi!! well, anyways what was i talking about?stuff. ohhhh my laziness. that's a long subject. i am very lazy, but i really need to work on my laziness. i am trying to do this, my mental laziness is not very bad, but physically i don't do as much as  i like. so, i guess signing up for intramural sports was a good thing. i am going to try flag football this semester. and i really want to play ping-pong (a. k. a. table tennis, as i  should probably start calling it). i was a little. ok very. upset when i lost so many times the other day, i don't normally play as bad as i did that night. i just used a contraction, i was told not to use those in formal apers so i try not to ever use them in any type of written assignment, or even when talking o frieds, apparently i did not follow through with that a few moments ago. well, other than that i am kind of at a loss on what to write. i am very hungry now, probably has something to do with the food i am smelling. i wishi could gain some weight. which reminds me, i used to go around saying how much i wanted to be fat, but i quit saying that when some friends of mine told me how much that they did not like me saying that. my hands are getting tired and my mind is starting to sleep. my eyes are shutting too. not good when i have 8 minutes and 16 seconds left. oh well . i want to go eat now. i have a lot of homework tonight. i won't get to do anything fun, i won't ever get to do anything fun on the weekdays, i may have taken too many hours, but then again is college supposed to be asy???? no its not. ( i used that contraction again). . and i forgot the apostrophe, haha. anyways college is supposed to be hard. so, i should probably enjoy working on homework 6 horus a day, catching up on the weekends while i do laundry, and then on the weekend nights i get time to play ping pong and be with other dean's scholars people and play intramural football with them. speaking of which i played ultimate frisbee the other day. err i mean yesterday. it was great, it was good to have some more physical activity in my life. i scare myself cause my abs. well, where i should have abs at least. still hurt from limbo three days ago. also my legs hurt to. my roommate just said scrotum. i have no idea why. scares me a little more . just thought i would let you know that. he is nuts, i guess i should go back to what i was tlaking about earlier. food. haha, i wonder how many words i can type per minute, this would not be a good excercise to try out that theory though, cause if you take an averageit will be a lot lpwer cause i am getting very tired right now, that and i am not punctuating very well, and i am using contractions without the apostrophe's. my roommate just reminded me of george carlin. funny man!!! you should atch his stuff sometime, its hilarious. i am talking as if there is someone going to read this. oh, only a minute and a half left. my eyes are starting to see some funky shiznit on this screen. man, i am hungry. !!!!! heh, i just looked at the time and it said 19 11, reminded me of 9:11, i see that all the time, or at least i used to on the alarm clock, or any clock for that matter, then i got hurt and it no longer showed up.

"last saturday, my parents sold the house that i have lived in my entire life. even though it has been on the market for over a year, i was very upset. it seems to me as though my family is falling apart. i have three siblings, and we are all located in different cities and have our own homes in these cities. and since the place that my parents are moving to doesn't have rooms for us, where i am right now is my home now. where my brothers and sister live is their home now, and it doesn't feel like we are a family anymore. because the definition of a family is someone who lives together basically. even if we wanted to stay in the same place in my hometown, amarillo, we couldn't. there are six of us in my family, and my parents only have one extra bedroom. my sister only has one extra bedroom, so half of us are going to have to stay at her house and half at my parent's when we are in amarillo. it's so weird. i don't even know what i'm going to do when i drive past the house. i'll probably pull into the driveway not thinking. i do things like that all the time. without thinking, one day, i drove to my best friend's house because i was thinking of her, and she wasn't even in town. i just have to look on the positive side of this move and remember that it is what my parents want. they are so excited about simplifying their lives, but it is just hard to know that we will never be that family again under one roof. my family is the most important thing in my life, and i don't want that to change. i guess my biggest fear is having the relationships that my parents have with their siblings. they were close friends with their siblings, and now they barely talk to each other. now that my siblings and i are beginning to make families of our own, i don't want to lose any part of the relationship that we have now. i've gone through life making friends and growing apart, and it has been really hard on me, but my family has always been there. without that solid relationship, i don't know how life is going to be.

"     today is the anniversary of the attack on the twin towers. i havent been thinking about this all day, images or feelings appear or become evident now and then. i sometimes feel very emotional to the point where my eyes my moisten up, and sometimes i feel a bit angry or nervous, thinking about what the world is coming to. we aren't safe anymore, at least the way we were before the 11th. i mean the nice safe world i lived in two years ago was a comfortable one. i didn't doubt the future of humanity, our country, or our safety. now, i occasionally do doubt. and most of all, thinking about the 11th and how there seems to be evident hate, extreme hate, towards america, i am angry at the world, at people, i don't know who in particular just angry, that this the world my sister, who is 5 will grow up in. she is a very close part of me, i feel very close and love her very much. she's my   little sis.   and to think that she now has to deal with these new realities of the world and people and her country some day, is sad to me. i mean on ond hand i am thinking come on, nothing drastic is going to happen, you live in texas far from the events, far from danger, she will be fine, i will be fine. and then i get this sense of coumminty and how we are all in this together and how i am american and she is american and we are hated by people who have the power to kill many people, to infiltrate our country and live among us without recognition. this is bad. alyssa is her name, and she is so adorable, smart, funny, i would be devistated if anything happened to her, i would feel terrible if she felt scared or hopeless about the new world once she realizes what has happened. i feel that it's partially my responsibility to be there for her and educate her of the events and of the new ideologies that americans have adopted. i am responsible to help her through these events these new realities as much as i can because i do not want her to fear life. i want so much the perfect, safe, comfortable world i grew up in to be the world she will grow up in, but i face the facts and realize that it most likely will not be. i find myself still in this private world of disbelief or like i am alternating bewteen a world where i realize the new threats involved with iraq and the possibility of war. just recently, i started paying close attention to the news coverage of saddam hessein and his disregard to un weapons inspections and how he is a tangible threat to our security. realizing this, going to war is more of a possibility in my mind. i relize the seriousness of the iraq conflict, the seriousness of the 11th events, terrorists and all that now more than ever. maybe because i am older or am paying closer attention to the news, reading more articles in newspapers. nevertheless, i am bothered by this whole change in our world. i have a lot of homework to do, a girlfriend, tuition and bills to pay, a career to study for, i have plans of becoming a doctor one day and i have just recently realized how much work that is going to be. i never anticipated this much stress or responsibilities in college. i am 20, should this much stuff be present in my life?  you know, i heard amazing grace today played at one of the memorial ceremonies on tv tonight and was emotionally moved. that song always does that to me. it can played on the trumpet, piano, organ, or bagpipes-it doenst matter, it always gets to me. i wonder what it is about that song that moves me so much. that was the first song i ever played on the piano and trumpet if i am remembering correctly. i miss my parents, mostly my little sister. i am going back this weekend, but i am starting to contemplate whether or not that is a good idea because i have mcuh homework to finish. i guess thats another struggles i am dealing with in my life currently. i started thinking about how much i love my grandparents. they live right up a little path from our house in san antonio and i realized that they will not be on this earth for too much longer. i would see them all the time growing up and even through high school. now i rarely ever see them because i am in college. i will, hopefully, have years and years after their deaths to study or do whatever, is it wise and the best thing for me to miss out on the time i have now to spend with them?  is spending time in college worth the sacrifice i am making. why can't i spend as much time with them as possible now when we are here on earth together before they pass on.

"my toes are kind of cold, no, they're very cold because this room is always frigid. at least i've got my flannel pants on that are so comfortable!  i love them. i could live in them. my t-shirt isn't too warm, but it's okay. i'm kind of wondering how i'm going to do this for 20 minutes straight. my thoughts kind of wander, but i'm not sure how i can record them for that long. i have a kind of upset feeling in my stomach right now. i think i'm just hungry. the rest of me is very relaxed because of the day i just spent out at hamilton pool, swimming and hiking. i loved the cold water that felt so good after the hot sun beating down on me in the car and during the hikes. the hikes were fun, though, because everything was so clean and clear, and it was fresh and refreshing. i wish my desk went back farther because i feel like the monitor is right in my face and it is too big for me to look at the whole thing. i would like a less-focused perspective on it, but i guess that's a dumb thing to say because it's nice to have a big monitor and it's not such a problem. people down the hall are getting kind of loud. it kind of annoys me when they talk really loud all over the dorm, but i guess it shouldn't because i could always just shut my door and it wouldn't be a problem. plus, i know that i'm really loud a lot of the time, especially when friends come over and find my guitar, speaking of which, i need to get my guitar out of dave's trunk so i can practice it because they're so much better than me at playing and if we're going to do music for the happening, i need to be better. i'm wondering if i'm doing this assignment right. i mean, am i supposed to record what i think and feel right now, or if my mind wanders to tangents should i record that too?  i guess i'll just go with my stream of consciousness, like the assignment says. my fingers are going to get tired of typing. i feel like they are getting worn smooth by my fingers always tapping on them. i guess the real problem is that my fingers are cold so there is a kind of loss of sensation and they don't move so well right now. my fingers always get so cold during the winter, especially. i'm kind of dreading fall for that reason, but i love fall and winter, and i'm actually really excited about it. i wonder if i was reading this if i would think i am a negative person. i mean, the whole thing is about negative stuff: cold toes and fingers and stomach pains and annoying stuff going on around. i'm actually a really happy person, i don't know why i complain so much. i wonder if i do that in everyday conversation, too. i guess i'm kind of whiny, but i catch myself doing it so i stop-plus, people know that i'm not really serious about it, i just like to make noise sometimes. rrooooh, i like popping my knuckles-there i go trying to be positive-it's funny that that's what i came up with to be positive. i just did it, and it helps them feel so much more movable, which is ironic because it'll probably give me arthritis and keep me from moving them when i get old. oh well, it's a habit i can't seem to break. on my desk i have pictures of my cousins. they are so cute-the little ones, the older ones are just goofy and funny. i love them. just looking at them makes me laugh about dumb stuff that we've done. there is also a picture of my little sister making a really silly face into the camera. she's in her bathing suit, wearing goggles and everything. everybody laughs at that picture, including me. there is also pictures of a church retreat i did called happening. i love those pictures because that was probably the best week of my life and those people are probably my best friends in the world-except for my family because family has always known me and will always be there. i'm so glad that i'm saved. i used to never use that phrase bc i thought it was cheesy and overzealous, but it's so true. where would my life be without christ?  i just don't know. he brings me so much joy that it's overwhelming. i wish i could share that with everyone who has never felt it, but some people don't want to hear it. that's too bad because i know people who need christ (well, we all do, but i mean people who complain about a void in their life that they don't know how to fill) and they're the ones who i most want to tell about him, but there is such an attitude in society that you just don't  """"preach"""" to other people, and they would resent it if i tried to tell them. they don't realize that i just want to share-""""i know it can do it for you-you've got to know what it did for me. """" (song lyrics) but i'm labeled as one who judges-funny thing is that they're the ones who are judging me. my intentions are pure. it's not like i'm on commission-one extra year in heaven for every person you bring to christ-i just care about people and the lord, and i want to serve him and help them. it's the truth, you know?  if only i could just tap my experience into people so they wouldn't doubt me or think i'm false or that i'm just trying to glorify myself because i'm not. """"what do i care about pleasing men?  if i wanted to please men, i would not be a servant of god. """" gal 1:10 that's reagan's favorite verse. hmmm, i wonder if reagan is back in town yet. he went home for his dad's birthday this weekend. i should call him tonight, and now my 20 minutes are up so i can do that!  wow, that went fast. it's kind of scary how fast that went!

"my name is kate mayer. right now i am feeling extremely uneasy. lately i have been stressing out about everything, from school work to social matters. for instance, this week i have some type of homework due everday this week starting wednesday. last night i worked for five hours straight on homework. i had to make myself take a break and go to kin's corner and eat because i hadn't eaten lunch or dinner, there simply just wasnt enough time. anyway on wednesday i have this huge english rough draft due and the final paper is due on friday. i have a geology test at 8 in the morning on thursday, and i do not work well in the mornings, especially when i am stressed. i try to run in the kinsolving gym to take some of the pressure off me and it helps a little. i just get on the treadmill and go. thinking and making plans for the week and how i can manage my time wisely. i keep thinking that once the weekend comes, i will be okay. i'm going home to visit my family and friends and all my worries will be left here in austin. that scares me a little because i'm afraid i will be dreading coming back here because austin is my home now. that's another thing that gives me a little anxiety. right now i don't really feel that i have a home per say. i know that i am always welcome in victoria (my hometown) but i have a hard time considering it my actual home. kinsolving is my new residence but i feel uncomfortable calling it my actual home. i guess i just have to get used to it. even though i feel anxiety about this small issue, i do not feel much   homesickness   that freshman are supposed to feel for their parents and friends. i do miss them a lot but i have not been upset by the fact that they are not going to be around me for support or whatever i might need from them. i guess in a way i am really enjoying my independence. i was scared before i came here and i realize now that i am okay alone. there are a lot of times that i need to be with people and socialize but leaving my comfort zone is the best thing that i could have ever done. i have discovered so many things about myself that i didnt know i even had in me, such as my need for independence. right now my roommate just walked in. most people i have talked to tell me that they have spent about two hours with their roommate. i do almost everything withe mine. she is my best friend here. we think alot alike. our room is just the way we wanted it, if not better. there are 11 posters of famous celebrities like marilyn monroe and bob dylan. our room smells of perfume cause we both spray it non stop, not because it smells bad but because. well i'm not exactly sure why. my mind is going blank. thinking. okay there is no air condition in our room or if there is, it is extremely hot in here and we have a fan blowing all the time. i live in supplemental housing so this isn't an actual dorm room-i think it is some kind of storage room-but in any case, i like it here. it feels cozy besides the temperature. im thinking that if i still live here in the winter, i will be okay because it's always hot in here. who knows?!  anyway i am extremely tired, it is so hard making myself get up in the morning and go to class. the only reason i get up every morning is because i'm so afraid that i am going to fall behind. actually, i feel that i am always behind. i do not procrastinate, or at least i try not to, but there's just something inside me that makes me feel that there is always something that needs to be done and i cannot slip up and get caught behind. i always leave extra early for things just so i will not be late. i have a math class right after my rhetoric and composition class, which is all the way across campus. i am always late for my math class and it bothers me so much. it scares me to miss the first few minutes of that class because i might have missed some important information like homework or some change in the schedule. i guess you could call it paranoia, i don't know. well, i think that since i've always been this way, i work well under pressure. i don't really like it but, but i'm so used to it. maybe that's a good thing coming to a big university. time's up!!

"well, lets see, i'm writing for about thirty minutes here in my dorm room and well, i'm actually not sure what to write about. i guess since you are going to read this a little i should just tell you about myself. my name is robert barajas and i am a freshman here at ut. i am originally from el paso, texas, but i am rather familiar with the city of austin already because my brother has been coming here for the past four years. i am in the longhorn marching band and i play the tuba! besides your class i'm taking astronomy, philosophy, and a freshman seminar. what i really like about the university is that i get to meet all sorts of people. i've even made a new friend here in your own class. her name is amanda and i think she might become one of my friends by the time the year is over. but i've learned over the years that whether it happens or not is not the most important thing. life will go on either way, whether we're friends, whether i pass your class, or even whether i decide to just sit at home and do nothing. that's the beauty of life. but it could also been since as the travesty of it as well. i consider myself to be a rather enlightened individual and so i have a rather morphed way of seeing things. i am my own island of tranquility in this sea of chaos. but chaos can be beautiful as well. umm, its only been like six minutes so far so i don't know what else to write. i guess i could just type the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, just to improve my typing skills. improvement is always a good thing. i believe that people are too preoccupied with the accumulation of material things. and that the only way to deal with this would be to take away all material things. like people are not humble and they should be. i'm still in the process of finding ways to implement this idea, but most of these are still on the drawing board. like if someone created free energy and just gave it out to everyone, i belief that that might completely destroy the economy and that would be good. money serves no purpose but to bind us to our material things. or, on a more serious note, what i think the people of the world need is some lifealtering event. perhaps wwiii would suffice. that way everything and everyone would be dead and the few survivors would have to band together and realize that there is more to life than what we have now. there should be no prejudice or racism. only on what people think should people be criticized, not on what they look like. that it shouldn't matter on their appearance but on the quality of their thoughts. even that sounds a bit wrong to people but its just because most don't envision the same thing as me. oh, well, whatever. these are just some random thoughts that i'm having. take care and god bless. bye.

"i can't ever seem to remember my passwords. and this lack of remembrance has really started to effect my disposition. everytime i try to log on to a computer, i can't remember one password from the other and it has gotten to the point where i just want to kick myself in the head. most of the time i just want to lie down and go to sleep. people keep on staying over in my apartment and i just can't get any sleep in the night. i can't survive with this for much longer. sometimes, i wish i was going to a faraway place where no one knows me and i can remain anonymous forever. i don't have to wash dishes for my roommates friends or clean up after anyone. i also wish that my parents would trust me everyonce in a while. i know my limits. i care enough about myself and my future to not screw it up. before, i didn't care about much anything but lately i've come to realize this lack of compassion, even for a moment, has adverse effects. i've come to realize that every second matters and every second can be utilized and it is only when you are satisfied that you were ahead in some way this second than the last is the only way to truly be content. humans, especially the ones here, are really ignorant of some basic kindness. they seem to forget that they are not the only ones with feelings. and they also think that they know nothing of what they are doing to you when they know perfectly clear. butterfly in the sky. i think most birds can fly twice as high. i was sitting in the chem auditorium in welch and it just hit me the magnitude of this university. it's freaking huge. there are more people in that auditorium then in my graduating class. i'm pretty sure i'm going to get carpel tunnel syndrome. all this typing since the last 5 years constantly plus all the ones in the next 50 years will have some sort of negative effect. i want to dye my hair brown. but then i'll be just like every other indian. there are more indians here than in all of the rest of america combined. after caucasians, indians seem most prevalent. dell and gates signed a deal for a huge merger. it was one of those things which i don't really care about. everyone makes fun of gates but i don't see why. the man is worth billions. he could have people killed. at the moment, there's no one i'd like to injure severely, i think i just might want to kick a few of them in the head.

"right now i am thinking about the convocation i have in about 45 minutes. but i'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking mexican that i have seen yet. ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things i don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. i think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad i think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. he's not really my friend but i sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. i'm going to be so behind in economics. i tell you. i really like that class though. so anyways. i know how this goes because i thought everyone would be nice and friendly but i was met with blank stares when i smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. a very few. whatever. i am still going to smile and i am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise i will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. i just put """"so anyways"""" instead of """"so anyway"""" i think that sounds as dumb as """"laters"""" when one really means """"later"""". that is really very jr. high. i miss those days. i wonder how cindy is doing. ugh. i really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and i will be an outcast once again. i'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. damn that sounds really conceited. maybe i'm a little of that too. i considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but i think that's pretty dumb considering i really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. it's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. i confess that i too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty. but if you know it about yourself i think it is worse to act like you are modest and humble than to just admit it. within reason that is. so anyway. i am these things but i feel like people don't want to reach out and meet new people and therefore i get shafted. i know they will like me if they get to know me but it's that introducing part that is really limiting. kind of stops the whole getting to know you thing prematurely. i am so proud of myself lately. i am being such a good girl. although my habit of exercising everyday at 5 has been rudely interrupted with today's events of the five o'clock dinner at trudy's which was pointless to attempt because i missed it anyway. i should have just gone to work out anyway and not let meetings and such get in the way of my schedule esp. when they are unimportant. i'm really irritated by that. but back to the story. i have been developing such good habits. i make my bed everyday, i wash my face twice a day, i get all my assignments down early or at least i begin them really early. o shit. i just got a little flash of procrastination. that sneaky devil. no go away!!!. i'm not going to be a procrastinator this year. i just don't have the time for that. i run every day . mon-thurs. 2 miles a day. plus i see a few cute boys in the gym that's always nice. kind of a motivating factor. when i get back from the convocation i'm going to go run otherwise my whole system will be screwed up. damn that dinner. ugh. what else do i do. o yea. i didn't even go out last weekend and i had no desire too. i haven't been drinking. i haven't been too flakey. with the exception of ross but that's quite not my fault most of the time. anyway we are good terms at the present. i'm being a pretty good daughter. i finished my scholarship applications stuff. what to write about now. i want to write about something cool. no luck. i really want to join the p2 chamber music group but i hope that they allow flutes. bad flutes in lol. i'm probably really bad by now. i wonder if there is practice rooms around. i need to find one anyway to practice the piano anyway. i thought it would be a lot easier to get guys here. i thought they'd be all confident and just come up to you. and then i would act all shy and innocent. it's just how i act. natural reflex to wanted attention. sometimes i think i'm so stupid. and then they would flatter me and ask me out. and i would act like i wasn't really sure. i little bit suspicious of their motives. (and rightly so i imagine) and then i would say ok and give them my number and things would be lovely. well i have to go to the convocation that will steal hours of my life away. see yaw. this has been a pleasant venting experience i tell you.

"right now it id 9:30 in the morning and i wish that i was still asleep. i had a biology discussion this morning and it was really boring. i don't really understand what goes on in that class. science isn't my best subject, but i guess i am going to have to improve that because my major is mainly based on that. and if i don't do well in those classes, i can't get accepted into upper divison. i'm not sure. i have been thinking about changing out of nursing because i really want to dance but i just don't think that there is a living in that profession. but at least i would really enjoy it. i wish i were more like my bestfriend in that aspect. he does what he wants because he wants to do it. he isn't worried about his future and i know that's kind of bad, but he really loves what he does. and he is good at it. i just don't seem to be good at much of anything and school just worries me. i wish i could push myself more, but i just don't have the motivation. i try at least. my classes are really hard and i am worried about doing well in them. this is my first time to be away from home and i want to prove to everyone that i am not as incapable as everyone thinks that i am. my own boyfriend doesn't really have faith in me. he thinks that i can't hold my own and that i have to depend on everyone else to help me through what i do. and maybe in some aspects that is true. i have had a difficult time just being myslef. i feel like people don't want to talk to me, or that what i say isn't as important as the next person. enough about my problems though, right? today i am going to get a tattoo. i have always wanted one and i have never had the nerve to go and get one. i think it is going to hurt really bad but i think that i am finally ready for one. i have been looking at what kind i want and printed some out off the computer. i hope that they can do the one that i want. i guess i am just going to have to wait and see what happens with that. today i have 3 classes left to go to. this being one of them. i have a hard time paying attention in this psychology class. i just can't seem to get interested in it for a complete hour and a half. all of my other classes are just 50 minutes and it seems easier to pay attention in them. but i added this class so 3:30 was the only time that was left open. i had to take it. thinking about school, i am going to go home and take summer school at sfa. i feel that if i can get some credtis there and transfer them here that it might take some of the load off for next year. i already came with 6 hours but that isn't very many. i am really determined to get into upper division nursing after 2 years. i don't know what i will do if i don't. i guess i will just transfer back home and go to school there if i can't get in here. but i really want to prove that i can get in here. i am trying really hard in my classes, but it just doesn't seem to be doing me any good. i read what i am supposed to and work the problems, but i just can't seem to learn the material. i'm not taking any dance classes right now which is really ackward for me. i have never gone a year without dancing. last year i was dancing 4-6 hours every week day and this is just strange. i don't excerise in any other way than that so i am starting to feel out of shape. dancing was my way to let everything out. i wasn't always as good as i wish that i could be, but it was a way for me to prove to people that i was good at something. here i can't do that. i am just another person walking down the side walk. at home, in such a small town, everyone knew who i was. and here i think i know about 20 people at the most. none of my friends came here so it isn't like i really have a relase. i am going to go home this weekend, and i know it is kind of soon, but i really miss my boyfriend. maybe i am just not cut out for this large college atmosphere. it might be best if i go home, i know mom and dad would like that a lot more. but i am tired of doing everything for my parents. i never did anything in high school for myself. mom and i got into arguments all the time and it seemed like my whole life i was just trying to prove myself to her. she treated me like a child even last year, like i was still 12 and couldn't take care of myself. being an only child i was smothered by my parents and grandparents. i don't know. it was nice getting what i always wanted, but sometimes i wished that there was someone else there to put the blame on. it's hard to handle everything that went on in my family. someone once told me to write down what bothered you and it would make you understand better about what was going on and how to fix it. it doesn't work. besides, i get tired of writing all of that down. i am super duper hungry right now buti don't want to eat because i am really afraid of the freshman 15. i haven't been eating well lately. i won't eat most of the time, but then it seems like when i actually do eat, it isn't anything healthy. the only good we have in our room is gronola bars and froot loops. like that is healthy. at least i have been drinking a lot of water. well, my time to write is almost up. thank god because i am really getting tired sitting here and doing this. also, i have a class in 15 minutes and i really need to leave and go there. so, i guess i have a couple more of these things to do during the rest of the semester. fun fun fun, i can't wait.

"what is love of an emotional basis? how do you know you are in love? is there a boundary to love? are there limits? many people ask these questions, including myself, but cannot find an answer to these questions. i believe that this can only be found out by experience, where you test these limits and grow by it. i have noticed in my personal life that i grow emotionally and mentally each time i find a new partner. love must be a learning experience right? it seems to be that way. i was first involved in a relationship in my sophomore year of high school, were i felt as if i was in love with this girl. we took it to the extreme where we contemplated about getting married and planning the number of kids we would have. but this form of love seemed to build so quickly. as i looked back at the letters we wrote each other, it seems we fell in love in a matter of a month or two. how cold that be? does love come at once, or does it grow on you? nine months later, we ended our relationship. it seemed to be the most painful event i had experienced. i next felt like i loved a girl i barely knew. we dated, but nothing came of this, however the crummy feeling you feel after a relationship is over lasted almost a half year. how could someone i just dated for a span of a month create such an effect on me? by my senior year, sometime in january, i became interested in another girl. by this time i had felt that i had grew and i would be able to make this girl happy, and would not make he same mistakes i did with the last girls. as time passed my love grew for this girl, something i had not felt in so long and so strongly. eventually (1 year and 1 month) things deteriorated. how could i have let this love slip? i thought i had mastered the relationship sector of my life. during the summer i met a new girl, whom i am currently with. i don't want to make the same mistake i have before but is it inevitable. will this relationship be like the others, or will i love her stronger than the other girl?

"right now, my dad just left and i am feeling homesick and sad. even though by the time i left home i was so ready to leave, but now seeing him makes me feel really sad. it's not just that i feel sad but i feel guilty to. my dad is so awesome and when i lived at home i never really appreciated him. sometimes i can be so incredibly selfish and self absorbed. i guess experiences like leaving home are good for us because they help open our eyes and let us see things that we wouldn't ordinarily. at home i was in my own little world which revolved around my school, friends, and family. now being in austin with out any of these comforts, i feel much more vulnerable and also naive. living on the drag can open your eyes more than anything. my dad told me that just yesterday the bank underneath my building got robbed. that kind of stuff freaks me out because i go to that bank constantly and i just never expect anything like that to happen. i really don't understand why people do things like robbing a bank. i guess it's just hard for me to understand how people could feel like they have no other options than to just rob a bank. although it's probably naive of me to say this, there are so many organizations and programs out there for people which just go so unutilized. i really enjoy working a places like those. i am still consider pledging the apo frat. the only problem is that if i do it's still going to cost me money, even though it's not as much as normal frats. i'm really not sure i can afford that. i spend money so fast up here. i probably need to get a job, but i really don't want to. i think it would be so overwhelming if i was to get a job. it would be a fun way to meet people though. and my managers said that they would be more than willing to get me a job at any of the austin macaroni grill's if i wanted one. i really miss all of my friends from my job. next time i go home i am going to go up there and visit everybody. i am going to visit all of my friends also. i miss them all so much. last night i called mandy. it was so good to talk to her again. she is honestly the only person who really understands me. she understands all of this crap that i am going through with charles. i can not believe that i have been here for 2 weeks and he hasn't called me once. i have no idea what the deal is with him, but if he doesn't want to se me any more then he needs to let me know. well, time's up.

"it is not as though they dit down and say """"hey, i'm going to change who i am today, just for the fun of it!"""" and if they do they aren't serious about changing. i have changed. a lot. it almost scares me how i have evolved as a person over the past several months. my thoughts have changed, how i view myself and other people, how i respond to certain situations, my opinions, beliefs, morals, attitudes; they have all been dramatically altered since this time last year. the funny thing about this is the reason why. i always considered myself to be a person set in my ways, never to step out of bounds, never to go against what i thought was socially acceptable. on a small scale, i was my own person, unique in every way, but in the scheme of life, i was right there with every other middle class high school girl. trying to fit in, to wear the coolest clothes, listen to top 40 music, go to all the parties to make and appearance and be friends with certain people just because they were """"popular"""". then i met cody, and i realized that there was so much more to life that what i was used to. the world wasn't one big happy carousel, spinning and singing and whoever got the prettiest horse was best. no, that's not how it was. there were problems in the world, and i realized that i had been ignorant to them, and it wasn't right. i came to realize that there is so much hatred and apathy out there, and it's tolerated. not accepted, but tolerated, and that's wrong to. cody taught me that it's okay to stand up for what i believe in, even if everyone else wasn't doing it, to do it for myself. not to condone the racism, sexism, homophobia and bigotry that goes on behind closed doors. if we ignore it, it will only fester and grown until there's nothing anyone can do to stop it. i began to realize then that it doesn't matter if you're wearing polo jeans, or if your parents just bought you a  brand new mercedes, because in the scheme of things, it's all irrelevant and pointless. this message was made clear to me through cody and the music we listen to. it's okay to be different, it's okay to spike your hair and pierce your eyebrow, because the people who frown upon you for doing so are the people who are afraid of change, the same people that tolerate that same hatred i previously mentioned. it's okay for me to be different as long i know that i'm doing what's rights, and the two should never be confused. you can be considered a social outcast and still contribute more to the well being of society than some big shot in his three piece armani suit, (the epitome of luxury that most people in america idolize today) sitting behind his desk letting his greed for power and money boil into hatred to the point that he will step over all those """"lower"""" than him to get what he want's. this isn't right. yet this is the american dream. what is wrong with this picture?

"it is weird to be here because usually people are here and i could visit them but no one is at home. my brother is now doing all the stuff i did last year and it's kind of a weird role reversal. i am also frustrated because i am here and if it was normal circumstances jared would be here but of course his family decided to take a vacation and they are out of town. and it's so weird and frustrating to be here and not be able to just call him and see him, i guess it is part of the annoying """"sensitivity"""" that girls seem to employ. i need to get out of that habit. but, in an hour and a half or so, i will be driving back to ut and bringing my roommate's and also my friends from here. the whole situation did not work out exactly how we planned because i was going to stay here this whole weekend but then jill's ride got all messed up so if i don't bring her up today i have chris and emily who will be very disappointed and i would feel guilty if i just stayed here instead. but actually i kind of just do want to stay here at home for awhile and actually get some stuff done and just relax but i also am torn the other way too. whatever, my mind is so strange sometimes. and also i am feeling stupid writing all these thoughts down. am i going to be diagnosed with some kind of disorder by what i've written? rhetorical question. computers can be very frustrating. it is really getting on my nerves that i am not allowed to complete my pretesting requirement on here. at first i couldn't even access the screen to type in my social security number and then when i could do that it won't accept my password or user name. that is all very frustrating and i've tried all these different computers trying to access it. oh well. hopefully, i will finally figure it out. as i just skimmed over what i've written thus far, i am worried. the blurb above says there is no right or wrong thing to say but i have before, just done completely the opposite of what was intended on an assignment and i had to redo it so this makes me slightly nervous as to if the content of this is adequate or not. it is very quiet in this area right now and my thoughts seem so loud in comparison since they are all that i can """"hear"""" and it all the activity that is going on. this assignment is actually kind of ironic because usually, i do write down everything that is in my head, like my thoughts and my feelings, and it helps me sort things out. it usually angers my friends because then they never know what upset me before because i wouldn't say anything because i'd have to go write it down to figure it out. yet, while i'm typing this, it seems so forced to have to write down my thoughts. i guess because the """"audience"""" i am typing for is so unknown and i feel self conscious of what i write. i just thought about this calculus homework i've been trying to work on for the past hour or so. it is so aggravating to try and understand something and completely fail or only understand a little bit which does nothing for progress toward solving the problem. i guess that is something i miss. i miss my smaller classes where there was always a lot of discussion and interaction. i guess in a way i'm being selfish but i can't help feeling that way. oh well, i guess i am still in transition but i'm used to everything i just am not sure how much i like everything. well, i guess that is all my thoughts for now. i am so random sometimes. my train of thought that leads me to some comment or question is sometimes so mixed up and completely out of nowhere that i can't even believe how i think of some things. i'm not sure. but i bet a psychologist somewhere could figure that dilemma out. : ) ",1
"as i start this essay i am feeling a little wary because i am doing it a little late. i am starting to think about what to write. i think that if i don't write something intellingent i will come off as dumb or ignorant as to what i am feeling. i am also thinking erotic thoughts. i am also feeling embarassed for writing that down. i am scared that after reading this you will think that i am a pervert (which i am not). i am once again thinking about what to write; once again thinking that if i don't write something smart i will come off as dumb. i am beginning to think of friends from back home. people i left behind, family, friends, teachers with whom i had pretty good relationships. i am now thinking of a conversation i had with two other friends on a very private issue. my father comes into my head also, times i have spent with him after he and my mother seperated. then i think of times with my stepmother and how my mother would dislike it if she knew that i acknowledge her as someone related to me. i am now feeling a little anxious because i do not want my sister to come home right now and see that i wrote something about having erotic thoughts. i now am thinking of a girl in one of my classes. it isn't erotic, i am just thinking of what she looks like in the class and how i would like to talk to her sometime. then i start to feel a little down because i haven't made any really close friends in college yet, just aquaintences. again i am thinking about what to write. i just got an image of the capitol as it looks from the tower and i just thought about the tower. i think about going to mezes hall to sign up for an experiment. i am now worrying again because i haven't signed up for one.

(did you know that is you try to hit tab to indent it takes you out of the typing window. very annoying i must say) (i need a name. er, samsung monitor, ok the character's name is sam) sam had been a small child when his father disappeared, therefore he had little memory of him. all he could think of was being told stories as he was falling asleep or going to the occasional trip to the park. nothing really stood out to tell him what his father was like. many others that had known his father would tell him that he was an odd person, constantly coming up with random ideas or running off to work on something new and exciting, except that no one ever knew exactly what he ran off to do. they also told him of when his father was younger; he would disappear for days on end, supposedly off camping or exploring by himself, and would return different. how different, they could not quite say, but something changed in him. , not always for the better. often he would come back slightly depressed or would remain to himself for weeks, but after time, he would return to his energetic self. (i notice i seem to misspell quite a bit and even though i try to catch and fix the word as i type it, some words do get through without my notice and i'd rather not go back and change them. also i tend not to capitalize much when typing. this is probably due to the fact that i have grown to accustomed to writing in word and it will capitalize certain things automatically; that and i am usually too lazy to remember to do so. ) after sam's father disappeared the last time, his mother fell into a strange illness. there was not a doctor who they could find who could explain the sickness. it was as if something from another world. something definitely there but not  ",0
"so i'm sitting right here and my roommate and his girlfriend are abut to go out to sixth street. i have no real plans for tonight so i decided to do this assignment instead!  it's been sort of a crazy week. lots of things have been bugging me and you know no ones seems to care about some of the stuff that i'm going through right now and yes i am going through a lot of personal problems but i don't want to write about those because i've talked about them enough this week ok, my roommate and i sort of get along but i'm never really sure how good of friends we really are but who cares i went to see loveline tonight and some people asked some pretty crazy questions people are so afraid of sex in this country i mean really everybody's thinking about it and that's all anyone really cares about i mean sure there is friendship and all that but come on sex is part of it too. how many friendships develop over some kind of sexual relationship or develop because someone needs advice about a sexual relationship? sex sex. it's like the underlying cause of all of our actions (who we make friends with, how we act, dress) and i'm not having much but that's another story. i mean i don't have that much of a sex drive to begin with, i personally think that sex and intelligence are somehow related-cause stupid people are always having it with other stupid people. you never see two brains getting enough, maybe its like a hormonal thing that people with low ig just have more testosterone although my best friend in high school was the valedictorian of our class and she was as horny as they come. maybe it's just me. sex creates too many problems, issues but its like we all need to express those feelings and i haven't been able to  oh well it's been 20 minutes and i'm tired ",1
"     this is kind of new and interesting. i have never done my homework like this before. i accutally tried to get on the computer to do my prescreening, but the computer isn't loading the page so i thought i might atleast complete my writing assignment. psychology is such an interesting field to study. it is my major in fact at this moment. i don't know if i will change though. the reason why i chose psychology as my major is because my family for a large part suffers from bipolar disorder. i was always told by my parents, since it is genetic, then one day i will have to face the fact that i will also be afflicted with this disorder. with my fate already laid out before me, i thought i might learn more about this disorder and how the brain works in general. i never liked the concept that my destiny is laid out before me. i mean, yes, genetics do play a certain role in who the person i am, but i don't think it determines everything. i guess this is only part of the whole nature-nurture arguement. this experiment reminds me of some sort of journal. i was thinking about starting a journal and writing down all the interesting experiences i go though in my college carrer. i am so lazy though, i know i will fail to write down something one day and one day will turn into two days and then i will probably forget to write in it all together. i know it would be beneficial, both psychologically and emotionally if i were to reflect on everyting, but it seems to me the time spent on writing down all my thoughts is more valuable to me than accually having a journal itself. a dark haired man just sat near me. he didn't sit at the computer directly near me. i wonder why that is? does he think i smell? does he think that i will become offened? does he find me unapproachable? or is he just scared of women? i never understood the concept really. people tend to perfer to sit with an empty seat between them unless assigned or told to sit next to one another. i do the same sometimes, but other times i sit next to the person anyway. for instance, i sat next the this guy who had a richy-rich hair cut in my psych. class. he wasn't very charming. that's okay because i wasn't interested in him in that context anyway. i tryed to make friendly conversation just for the sake of conversation. i hope he didn't think i was hitting on him because i wasn't. he really isn't my type. he is in the business school. ehh. i mean nothing is wrong with that i guess, but people who are business majors should just wear a sign saying 'i want money'. nothing is really wrong with that either because money is good to have, but to focus your life's carrer on that seems kind of mundane. i think money is important, but not as important as knowledge, wisdom, and happiness. i guess it is because i grew up having absolutely no money. people may say they have no money, but really i have no idea how i ate dinner. i was that poor. i think it is because of this, i tend to value education. i look for people who are cultured and knowledgable about soceity. that to me  ",0
"i am constantly thinking about the past. i often think about the good things that have occurred in my highschool years. i feel really sad because i miss my family so bad. i am always thinking about how i never get in trouble anymore because my parents aren't here to get mad at me whenever i come home late. i feel so lonely here. nobody knows anybody. everywhere i turn i see different faces that i probably wont ever see again this semester. i feel so depressed because my boyfriend is gone. i am always dreaming about being together again, but its not going to happen ever because we just broke up. i miss him so bad and i can't ever be with him anymore just because i have too much darn pride. i wish i didn't have so much pride. pride gets me nowhere all it does is leave you wondering what could have been? or where would i be standing now with him had i not been so proud. i am so sad, but then again i would rather have alot of pride than no pride at all. i wonder what i'm going to do with my life. everybody seems to know exactly what they are good at. i don't!! i'm totally lost i don't know what i'm the best at. how are you supposed to know what career is the best one to choose. i want to do good in school but people don't work to the best of their ability unless they have certain goals. i'm not determined. i don't know if i will be successful dancing ballet or operating on some dying person. i'm too confused. i'm happy i have my brother i love him so much i don't know what i would do without him. i'm really hungry . i didn't have breakfast, lunch or dinner because i was too mad about my boyfriend or ex-boyfriend i should say. i can't think or sleep or eat i don't know what to do should i let go of all of this pride that i have? no, it will be better for me in the longrun. why do people get hurt so much. i don't understand my mind knows that things happen for a reason. i know deep down inside that for some reason this happened and that things will get better, but i'm hurting so bad inside and i still want to smile at people and say hi to my friends even when i don't want to talk to anybody. i don't understand why i have to feel horrible and my friends are all having a blast. why do some people live the best life and others don't get it so easily. it's not fair to have some people be happy all the time and others who are born without an arm or who's parent's have died or who have some sickness why them and not me for example?

"yesterday, i went tubing with my family on the guadalupe river. it was a blast!  it was the first time since i moved to college on ague. 20th that i have spent time with my mom and sister. they are the two people that i miss the most back home and i was so happy and relaxed to get to spend time with them. i also got to see my little baby puppy bichon frise named bebe who is absolutely spoiled rotten. it was weird going home and sleeping in my own bed for a night but it was also a great get away from school to just hang out with my family. i guess that i have been putting off any kind of homesickness by staying busy with school and trying to meet as many people as possible. i find that the more that i see my family the more i think about them and get sad so. i am refraining from going home for just that reason. i am waiting to find out if i am going to get an interview from the texas spirits and i have mixed feelings on whether or not i want to join. part of my doesn't want to be joining an organization i am not 100% interested just because i am looking to meet some new cool people, but on the other hand i need to get involved in something at ut so that i can find so sense of belonging in this large school. i definitely am worried that if i get busy with an organization i would overstress about my classes and meeting the clubs requirements as a member. deep down i know that most of my worries are pretty trivial compared to most peoples problems. i know that i am  very lucky just to get the chance to go to college and that is why i am so concerned on whether or not i am going to blow it. i am very concerned about my chemistry class and i  have been thinking about how much i need to study all weekend. . well, two classes ago we discussed on a scale from 1-10, what is your fear of death. my feels like it is 20. this is not because i lack a faith that their is a higher being or an after life, it is because i am afraid of losing someone i care about while i am away at school. i have been thinking a lot about a friend of mine who was going to be a sophomore at ut this year who passes away suddenly from a pulmonary embolism'clot. i am now grieving the loss of someone so young and so beautiful that i feel that my sense of security has been ripped away from me. i am now thinking if someone so healthy and young can lose their life so suddenly, whose to say that the couldn't be my brother'sister or mother'father. i guess that you could say that i am one of those people who worry to much and i worry that i will lose someone again and i wouldn't have had the chance to say goodbye. anyways, this all sounds so childish and """"heavy"""" for an 18 year old college student to be thinking about. well i am so happy that these 20 min. have flown by and i can get to my real homework. it really felt go to get all of my thoughts out in a way that was quick and easy. i hope that i can get all of my work done tonight so that i don't get behind this week. this was a great assignment, i would not mind doing more of these. have a great day!

"it seems to me that the purpose of this assignment is not really to examine our mundane thoughts that we perceive but the logic behind the way our mind thinks. since most my time is spent analyzing my thoughts and their processes i think that i must examine more of the logical progression.       this entry to me simulates making an entry into my journal. i look at that and realize that everything in their is exactly what you want. the most interesting things that i think about and that lead into other realms our my interactions with other people. today at dinner i saw my ex-girlfriend from high school. she wasn't just a high school crush but the relationship lasted for over a year. after our break up things went down hill to the point that we don't ever talk to each other any more. she sat down with my roommate because she was with a mutual friend of ours. it is odd the way that the alliances from my old group of friends turned out. my roommate and i  can see because we have been friends for a long time and we never ran into the point where there was never any conflict between us. one of my other friends who i used to love more than any other person in the world is still a good friend but not quite ion the same level as we were once on(over my girlfriend we separated because he had just broken up weigh her a month earlier.     that brings up a question that everyone tries to answer:  is friendship or a relationship more important?  all three of us were best friends but i bet with my ex that we could go to a higher level and stay there. the question that developed inside was it really a different level or another aspect of the same. i almost lost a lot of my friends for her, but those friends are the only ones still around.     i wonder if this philosophy or psych?  does it really matter. the problem i think with a lot sciences now days is that the focus is so small that their lack of background in other subjects prevents us as moving as far as we might. how can a man consider himself able to study minds without the back ground of the philosopher. he must have explored his own thought and beliefs enough if is to ever have the hope of trying to understand others. schools inside psych seen contradictory. how can one just study the physiological aspect without considering the developmental. psych in its self probably should not be a major but the aspiration of the one who would devote himself to biology, philosophy, and sociology. the thing that irks about most of psych is that they seem to indoctrinate their own school of thought onto the tablet of their students mind. i believe in an approach that provides the conflicting theories in order to allow the student to make up his own mind.   the problems with a lot of classes and student is that they do not teach the children the ability to come up with conclusions for themselves. how is the man who can purely memorize the data of other smart. he is a machine that must have data read in to perform a certain task. those that can create an idea or image to provide those others is the one who deserves praise. he is the man who provides others with everything they receive in life. even in the arts we have gotten to the point where it is simply regurgitating knowledge instead of creating it. those students who take band tell me they have a hard improvising because they were just taught to read the music.     the door to true knowledge is creativity and self-examination.

"i am sitting in my room and i look around to see my roommate and my boyfriend. trying to make my train of thought come to me so i can type it. all i can think about is all my boyfriend's theories about life and his many different issues. he believes in """"boxism"""", he was a little out of it when he thought of this, were everyone was born in a box which was placed in a bigger box, hospital room, which is part of a bigger box, the hospital hall, which is placed into a bigger box, the whole hospital building itself. then he goes on to state that we are then taken home and put in a box, the crib, which is in a box the room, part of the bigger box the whole house. after this we go to school and the classroom becomes our box after we graduate we our placed in our dorm room box and walk from class to class or box to box. after we finally manage to get a job our cubicle or office which then becomes our box. then he goes on that when we die they dig a box and put you into a box. my boyfriend's theory always brings a smile to my face as i remember when he first told me this. wow, that only took me ten minutes. i look around my room and see all my pictures and think about going back to high school, i believe that those are some of the best times in my life. my class was very small and we all got to know each other very well. i have always been told that college is the best time of you life but it will take a lot to compete with high school. i hope it becomes the best time of my life. i have already come to enjoy it and have become adapted to college life. i love being able to do whatever i want when i want to. i hope these next few years will become the best years of my life.

"i feel kind of strange doing this assignment like this -- i don't think i've ever had such an informal assignment. i just got off the phone with this girl that i met in galveston when i was a junior in high school -- the whole time i was talking i was also thinking about how i wanted her to shut up so i could do this assignment. well, anyway, here i am sitting before this crt not really concentrating or doing anything special -- just king of chilling. my roommate is playing quake on his computer on the other side of the room -- also the radio is on and so it makes it king of hard to concentrate with all the noise in the room. i think the artist on the radio is natalie merchant -- damn i really hate her music -- it's so poppy it's disgusting. everything the drums to guitars to vocals sounds so devoid of feeling or meaning -- it's a mind numbing, spirit-crushing experience listening to this crap . i just wish she would shut up . i prefer bands like korn or pantera. they sing with so much feeling, and all the songs are sung with vehemence and anger and lust and disgust and hatred. the entire spectrum of emotions is explored in their works. other favorite bands of mine are helmet, alice in chains, pearl jam,etc. i guess i kind of got caught up in the whole alternative revolution phenomenon. i wore flannel and had ripped up jeans and doc martens and i even did the drugs that went along with the whole alternative scene. a big mistake in my opinion because those vices with which i experimented last their taboo and so now i have no fear of them and would have no qualms about taking them other than the fact that they destroy your body and mind. now i only drink -- another result of my experiments with """"alternatives"""". it's funny because in high school i was a drugger and an """"alterna-teen"""" when i was wishing that i could be a musician. but now that i am one -- i have my own band -- i don't really feel the need to do live the alternative lifestyle. i don't dress strange or have strange habits. i have a 4. 0 gpa and was the valedictorian of my high school, so that kind of belies some of the things that i've said here. better man by pearl jam just came on the radio. i like this song alot. pearl jam's not as good as they used to be. their albums ten,versus and vitalogy are much better than the album no code in my opinion. no code seems so sterile and not pearl jam. i think it has a lot to do with the fact that they have a different drummer--the old drummer from the red hot chile peppers. he sucks in comparison to dave abbruzzese--the old drummer for pearl jam. i wish they would put out another awesome album. if they did i would be very happy. oh yeah, my roommate just reminded me about this girl that i know. she's a fat girl and she's kind of a bitch. she keeps calling me and calling me, but i don't want to talk to her because i don't like her 'that' way at all--but she likes me like that. . . . i kind of like living in jester because it is very close to everything that goes on campus. the food sucks really badly, but there are plenty of beautiful girls that live here---so that is really cool. i just glanced at my watch because i am timing my time here on this assignment. i only have a few more minutes to do this assignment. i just thought about how delicious my supper was today at my friend drew's uncle's house. we had badass barbecue and he gave us beer and margueritas. he was a really cool guy. i want to go back there sometime and hangout again. he's got a really nice house and he's building a studio for recording. that will be cool. maybe my band-the goodside-will be able to make use of this to record some stuff in there. we have our own studio but it's in the dorm room so it's not really easy to record all the time in there because you've got to take into account other peoples' sleeping habits and wants and needs--that's another thing that suchs about the dorms. it kind of cramps the lifestyle of someone who makes a lot of noise. well, i've gone over my twenty minute minimum, so i'll go ahead a start reading for other classes. .

"well i'm sitting at my computer and i don't really have much to say. for some reason i feel as though my mind is completely blank. my roommate just walked out the door and he is about to get ready for class. i am so tired right now. last night i was up with no thoughts in my head. i was just not able to sleep for some reason. i really hope that this school year goes good for me. i know it is going to be tough but it will be worth it. i have always dreamt of coming to college and now that i am finally here it still seems like a dream. i guess its just hard to believe that i'm on my own, six hours from home. i miss my old friends and my girlfriend, laura, i can't wait to see here this weekend. football season is about to start and i am getting so excited to see my first longhorn game. my mind just went blank again. no thoughts. i think i just used to many dots between words. my nose itches. i need to use the bathroom, but i still have eleven minutes to go on this assignment, and i don't want to stop now. for some reason it seems as though i have been here typing for a long time but really i haven't even typed much. maybe i type slow. i'm trying to think of what to type now. it seems so easy. ?just type what you are thinking at the moment?, maybe i'm trying to hard. the phone is ringing. i guess i'll get it. it is was my mom. yes, she is going to put money in my bank account. that sounds good to me because i could really use it right now. it looks as though i have barely typed anything. i'm not sure how long this should be or what the instructor expects out of this piece of writing. man i'm thirsty. i could use a spite or a cold coke. maybe i'll go get one in a little while, or not cause i need to save money. it's tough not having a job and wanting so much. i'm just used to having money to spend on so much stuff that i don't even need in the first place. six more minutes and i will be done. it actually seems like a long time, but so far it has gone by pretty quick. i wonder how my dog is doing. i hope my mom is feeding her just as i said, and giving her lots of water. she needs that especially in the hot sun. i can't wait to go home and have her jump on me. no thoughts. still none. i think i'm getting addicted to the dot thing. two more minutes to go and now my eyes are glued to the clock. every second seems to go by slower and slower now. i really don't want to drive home this weekend. i wish i could fly, but i'll be alright. i just really don't like driving six hours it gets really boring just sitting there doing nothing but paying attention to the road. well it's been twenty minutes so i guess i'm done.

"     as of now i wonder what will become of me at the university of texas. these first few weeks have opened up many new experiences to me. being able to make decisions by myself and not have to worry what my parents think is weird to me. my dad was the principal at the same high school as me which limited me to what i could and couldn't do due to the fact that he had a reputation to uphold in the community. back in my home town people would associate me with my dad and hold me to different standards than everyone else at the school, but in college i don't have to worry about my fathers reputation and i can be the person that i really want to be. this is strange because my whole life i have had to worry what other people think of me, but these last few weeks my whole life style has changed. it is strange living away from my home town because many of my friends are there and i have lived there all of my life. i am sure i am going through the same things many other freshman are going through right now. having to meet new friends and find my place in austin is harder than i thought, but at the same time i like austin a lot more than i like my hometown. my roommate is cool and it seems like we will get along fine over the year. i was worried that i would get a bad roommate because i have heard so many horror stories about bad roommates, but i guess it turns out that i was lucky. i can't wait for the next ut football game. i missed the first one against north texas but i have my ticket for the one against houston. many of the people that i already know up here are going to be tailgating and have invited me to go with them to the game. hopefully during this time i will get to see some of my ex-neighbors that i grew up with. the television is starting to get on my nervous because some dumb movie is playing and this monkey keeps making stupid noises. i find it hard to try and write for 20 minutes straight. to follow my thoughts is hard because it seems i try to hide them even from myself. i think this might be due to the fact i could never say what i thought when i was growing up. i always had to follow the   norm   and if i didn't my parents would scold me and tell me not to think that way. since my parents both come from a more traditional up-bringing i don't have as many experiences as other kids have had.

"so i'm laughing right now because i think this is really weird. makes me feel kind of uncomfortable i guess, i don't know why though. but my stomach kind of hurts right now, my roommate and i just had some ice cream, so maybe that's why. i'm kind of stressed right now, and i hope i get everything i need to get done done tonight. i'm really tired and i just want to go to bed. i'm really hot in my dorm, maybe i should turn the fan on, but i'm too lazy to get up and do that right now. so i'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing right now. i talked to him a few minutes ago and he was doing homework. i wonder what homework he has?  man, i'm really not looking forward to tomorrow. i have so much stuff to do, at least that's what i feel like. and i really want to go to tops to look at the pictures. hopefully claire will go with me tomorrow and do that. my foot is really itching me, i think i got bit by a bug tonight at the zeta house. i was outside doing my homework which was probably not a good idea, but oh well. oh i need to call my parents too. i wonder if they're having a good time in canada. i wish i was there right now. i miss them already, but i'm only three hours away so it's okay. i'll be fine. i really want to go running outside on the track tonight. it felt so good out earlier and i bet that would help with my feeling stressed out. but i probably won't because i'm so tired and my stomach still hurts. i wonder what's wrong with it. twenty minutes is a long time, i've only been writing for seven minutes now, wow. i hope i have fun this weekend. i'm excited about the ut football game. the last game was so much fun even though it was raining. i guess that made it more interesting. i'm looking at my pictures by my desk now and i really miss my friends from my hometown. i really miss angie, i hope she is doing fine at kingwood college. and justin, i hope he is still not mad at me. maybe i should call him tomorrow, i think i will. and i can't believe kristin got her nose pierced up in colorado. she is a wild one, but i guess that makes her who she is. i wish i was in colorado. i love the mountains and the nice weather there. i bet she is having a great time at school. i'm spacing out right now. i never thought i could have writer's block when i'm writing about what's going through my head. that's really weird. and i'm saying really"""" a lot. i guess i like that word or something, who knows. i need to go to the bathroom, but i only have about seven more minutes, so i'm just going to wait it out. is going to even a word?  i'm not sure. i'm thinking about tomorrow again and hoping that my ta for calculus teaches well tomorrow. i can't really understand him and i really need help in that class, so hopefully he will have some good things to say. our sink in the room keeps on dripping and it's really bothering me. i wish it would stop. claire just got a phone call, i wonder who it is?  she is a cool girl, i'm glad i'm rooming with her. if i had to room with a complete weirdo i would freak out. that would be horrible. i think she is talking to her somewhat """"boyfriend. """"  they're dating i guess, and i set them up!  i did a good job. i guess he is coming up to our room right now. claire's excited!  i wish my boyfriend was coming to see me. he lives in riverside so i understand. i hope justin doesn't think i'm a complete slob when he comes up here since i'm in my pajamas and have no make up on. oh well, i don't need to impress him anyways. it just got really quiet in our room. it's an awkward silence because claire just turned her fan off. she must be cold, but why and i so hot. i just popped my back and it felt so good. it's been pretty sore lately, but i'm not sure why. i just remembered that i have to read after this. that really sucks. it's going to be a long night i guess, but i can handle it. oh justin is here now, that's cool.

"i am in my dorm room in jester west staring at the keyboard. my friend's dad just bought me a new dell computer because mine was so old that it would not recognize ethernet because the technology is too new. i am listening to an allman brothers band cd that i downloaded and it's pretty good. i don't know if i'm doing this right but i guess i am because i'm just typing what i'm thinking. i had to wake up at 8 this morning for a ta session for calculus which was of no help at all. she gave us the easiest problems ever and the class ran late so i had to walk into my biology class after it had started. it seems in math the teacher always explains things that are so easy and when u get to the homework u find that its nothing like class at all. i am noticing crumbs on my keyboard from the new flavor blasted goldfish extra cheddar i sampled some in the campus store and they were so good that i bought them. ok now it is getting hard to type bc i keep thinking too hard i think. i am now downloading the movie super troopers. the very first thing that i downloaded after getting my computer was the movie yellow submarine. i love having kazaa because i never have to buy cds or dvds ever again. i have an hour until my next class which just so happens to be psy. after that i think i am going shopping because my dad's wife just sent me 100 dollars for a graduation present. my sister is iming me right now. she had an away message about how mondays suck or something so i told her to think about pollyanna haha i thought it was funny. my roommate went outside to study because our room is like 20 degrees below zero at all times. i like my roommate but she is one of those overly caring people. i feel so bad saying anything mean about her though because it seems like i inconvenience her more than she does me. well maybe not i don't know. i thought that the university would match roommates according to their time schedules and interests. haha it was kind of funny because i was just assuming that my roommate was going to be a person who listened to the same kind of music that i do because that was one of the questions that you had to answer. well she does not and she only has like 5 cds and they are probably the worst ever, well maybe not but avril levine is one of them which indicates a total lack of good taste in music for her part. it always makes me wonder when people are really smart but they like dumb things like she has serendipity. i am a big john cusak fan but that movie was awful everything they said sounded so practiced and forced it was disappointing, and i probably spelled that wrong i can never remember if there are 2 s's of 2 ps and maybe there are 2 of both i don't know i guess ill look it up after i am finished with this. which i almost am i have less than one minute left woo hoo no i'm just kidding, this wasn't too bad and i got to practice my typing. i can type pretty fast but i look at the keyboard and i  ",0

"it's been a long day and my head and body are tired. i think that my classes are going well but i feel a little worrisome due to the fact that i have not had a grade taken in any of them. i see people in school and wonder what they are thinking, and wonder why so many people are afraid. they seem scared to talk or to smile or even look up while they are walking this huge campus. with so many people around and the diversity being so big i feel they are missing out and are short changing the rest of their school by not being social. lately, work keeps awake at night. i always feel as if i have things to do but do feel like doing them. i get upset that my teachers make us read so much. they need to be more hands on to get my attention. also it seems as if school is not that big of a deal to my friends it bothers me because i don't like school either but i still have to do it. i guess this is what college is all about. the few that do take it seriously are the people that end up doing the best, at least i hope. but what happens to all the people that don't take it seriously. you always hear about those individuals that struck it rich because they didn't follow the norm. i wonder if i'm one of those people. i know that either way i'm lazy so i don't think i'll find out. i miss laura, i think of her a lot and i see her image in a lot of faces. i see curly hair and i imagine her walking, or if i see her figure on a girl i look up to see the face but its' not her. i wish she was here for at least a second. just that one touch of her hand made things better. she always made me laugh and happy. i think i did the same for her, but i still wish she was here with me. love is weird. i think love is something that everybody has with one another and with some it's even stronger. and that strong love is what causes the weird stuff like marriage and so forth. but i wish people would only say love when they meant it. it's used so frequently that now it doesn't have the same affect as it used to. but oh well who really cares. i think laura was the one person who understood what love meant to me, her and my mom both knew. but everybody else thinks i'm weird. why is a relationship bad to have even if it is long distance isn't that relationship better than not having one at all. i feel that if you really care distance can't stop what the heart feels even if you can't see, touch or hear them.

"this blank screen is staring at me and my fingers are moving in my peripheral vision and this screen is so retarded. i wonder why i put 3 dots at the end of that sentence and who made that up anyway. my shoulders are getting sore-i probably shouldn't type with my arms straight out like this. i wonder if that helps combat carpal tunnel syndrome-ok, i'm going to scoot up. i can't believe its sat at 700 pm and i'm writing this. i'm such a nerd. actually i'm not. ,. i'm cool--but that's all relative i guess. i'm really into drinking my coffee and i'm staring at my green porcelain coffee cup with its drip coffee stains already on the side from where my lips have been. steam is rising out of the top and i really want to pick it up and have a sip of it but then this writing isn't continuous is it?  jewel is playing in the background volume 5 and she's kind of distracting. here comes foolish games. i can totally relate. i wonder if scott is thinking about me right now--i hope he's not the t. a for this class. this is so incredibly weird. i think i like him but i'm not sure. he reminds me of scott wolf and i can't stand him is that a bad sign?   i like richard's accent too. wow english accents are really cute. like in london. all of the guys were so amazing. especially that one in the subway that looked like gavin rossdale but he was speaking italian so i doubt it was him. i wonder how liz is doing?  and michelle?  why isn't ken calling me?  i hate it when guys ask for your number and then never ever call you back. or else they wait a really long time to do it. kind of like max. i wonder how he's doing i wonder about his dumb model sister in paris. whatever. i love jewel. i want to play piano right now even though i haven't played in six years. my gosh it's 7 :20 already and this is pretty fun. i should probably get a diary and do this in it but then what if someone reads it and thinks i'm a rambling idiot?  i have an ache in my heart about the council. i wonder why my name isn't on the list?  i swear, my application was the best one out of all of them. they are so retarded. maybe it was too sweet and idealistic. maybe they think i'm full of crap and making it up. but i really think that way. maybe it's cause i was listening to jewel at the time,. i wonder when my roommates are getting home  they are so active. of course they didn't have to get up at 700am this morning for crew tryouts. ok, i probably didn't make it cause those chicks are total hosses. i have a lot of respect for those girls on the team. i wonder if st4eve will get back to me on being the coxin. i have no idea how to spell that word. my tongue is dry and why did i staple scott's number to an orange sticky note so it's staring right back at me?  he writes like such a guy. my walls are so bare. and the st4reaks of light from the blinds are coming in golden. i wish i could write songs like jewel. i want to play the guitar well too. i miss my dad. he's staring back at me from my wall and he looks kinda sideways and i wonder why i returned that dress. this screen is so confusing i lose my place my toe hurts and i feel full. my wrap was gross though. i can't believe they didn't take my cds--they're so retarded. my tailbone hurts and i hope i'm not sore tomorrow steve was a bit extreme. i keep hitting the wrong keys i really need to get to the container store and get some hangers but i know i need to do my homework. i hate calculus homework. i'm dreading it. i wonder why i'm so down and pessimistic today?  i'm usually not. oh--gosh, i've got so much stuff to do and organize and my thirty minutes is about done. i wonder if i typed more than other people did and i wonder if a ta. actually reads all this crap and how he grades it?  weird. maybe i should play my guitar.

"it's 5:27 and i am beginning this assignment. it's an interesting one. you never really pay attention to how your mind jumps from one thing to another, at least i don't. my roommate just came in. she thinks i am mad at her and i am a little. i'm always waiting on her and it's annoying. i hadn't eaten anything all day and i was about to go to the cafeteria and she wanted me to wait for her . thirty minutes later we start walking to the cafeteria and she decides she's not hungry. i had waited for nothing. we get along very well, but i don't think she realizes what she does. she keeps interrupting me while i'm writing this and it's timed. she got mad at me just now because i asked her to be quiet. she left the door open and there's someone playing their music pretty loudly. i really don't like the girls next door. we get along with the girls who live a couple of doors down very well. the one's next door just aren't very friendly. my roommate heard one of the girls slamming stuff around and griping because i was playing ozzy osborne. one of them is in choir and she's always doing voice exercises. i hope my roommate doesn't start acting like i'm mad at her or vice-versa. she's on the phone. her guy problems are pretty entertaining. i try to help her out, but i really can't empathize with her. she has a completely different approach and understanding with the opposite sex. zack is going back to graham tonight. he's one of my friends from home. i've known him since kindergarten. i've also been infatuated with him since kindergarten. maybe he'll decide he likes me too. i doubt it though. that's a depressing thought. oh well. there are plenty of other guys around here. in graham there were not even close to as many. population:9,000. graduating class: 134. that's why i came here. i wanted to be in a place with many other people. i have definitely found that place. a lot of people from graham thought i was crazy for wanting to come here. i guess different people want different things. it makes sense. one of our friends from down the hall just came in. she's very cool. she's going to let me use her computer to type this, which is sweet of her. it's very beneficial to know people. everyone has something to offer. of course, you have to give also. some are better at that than others. i know i've given plenty of cigarettes. hopefully i've contributed more than just that. i've offered advice, which of course i always thought was good advice. i've tried to be friendly. i've given complements. i've loaned money and shared food. o. k. , i've done my part so far. i think school is going to go well. i just can't let people take advantage of me like i have in the past. i think i can manage the academic  part pretty well. the only thing that is difficult so far is calculus and that was to be expected. i've been doing my best though, and that's all i can do.

"i am so cold right now, and i want to take a really long nap. i have so many things to do and i don't know where to start. i miss my family and my boyfriend a whole lot. i don't know if i like the whole idea of growing up. sometimes i wish i could be a kid forever. my roommate can sometimes become annoying and i just want to scream. my suitemates are cool though, although one of them smells kinda funny. i really want to go shopping this weekend and already can't wait for a break from school. the cafeteria food here is not that great. the enchiladas are fattening and spicy but the ice cream is good. i had the best ice cream the other day at coldstone creamery. it was cake batter flavor. crazy ,huh?  i am trying to be accepted into different organizations right now as a freshman and still balance my schoolwork. i am now happy to be in the school of education. so many people have put me down and discouraged me for wanting to be a teacher and then a principal. but i am glad that i have stood by my own convictions and passions to become what i truly would love to be. i think i need to take a shower. i want to have a family when i am older and i can't wait to get married and have kids. someone in this room needs to buy a mop because our floor is getting really gross. our shower is very small in the first place and combined with being dirty, well that's just plain bad. i've met some really nice girls in some of my classes and i hope to build some very good friendships here in college. i tend to get stressed out easily and am very anxious about tests and other important things. i play with my hair a lot and as a result i need to get my hair trimmed. people think it is ridiculous but i have done it since i was a child. i had a conflict with my sister this weekend. i hate to say this but sometimes she can be a very uncaring person. she is the only family member that lives close and she doesn't act like she wants me to be a part of her life. i think she is just self-centered and almost jealous of my involvement"""" in college which she did not take advantage off. it's not my fault that she lived off campus for her first year. i hope that they have a computer for me and don't run out at the computer store on friday. i really need one and hate relying on someone else's. i wish i was able to pay for it but right now i am unable to work and a thousand dollars is usually not in a college student's budget. my mom is the greatest mom there ever was. she would do anything for me. anything. i wish that her and my dad were closer though. when i was little we would always go on family adventures and now we seem to be more distant. i really hope that i can plan a trip to go on for spring break with my boyfriend. i have never really gone on a trip all by myself before. i wonder if my friend martin from germany is going to email me back. i haven't heard from him in awhile but i think sometimes he behaves in ways that i would not tolerate. i wish my razor didn't hurt my skin. i guess i need to buy a new blade. my little sister is painting her wall with a mural of new york city. she has this wild idea of becoming a dancer when she grows up but i don't know about that. my mom is helping her look at dance colleges right now but i think she should be a little more realistic. i really want to go home right now and eat a home cooked meal and take a shower where i can actually move around. i really need a hug and a kiss from my boyfriend. i am not used to being so far away from him and sometimes i worry that we are going to become distant and that our relationship isn't going to work out. i really could see us getting married but i guess i should leave that to god, if you know what i mean. i love pizza an ice cream. i wish they weren't so fattening. i need to go kickbox this week. it's not the same here as it is at 24 hour fitness. it's cool though. good exercise. i'm really tired of typing. i got to go tan outside today.

"     i'm thinking about how if i do this all the way through, i'll be late   in meeting my girlfriend because i still have to shower and change.  my clothes are in the dryer, getting wrinkle free because i'm too lazy   to iron them. i'm thinking about last night and how leah and ia have   been having some weird moments lately, but i think that i can   attribute them mostly to stress. yesterday in dr. boetcher's office, she   mentioned dana and him being the one that leah was dating. cat's   out of the bag. i know, of course, and i've known for a while, but still   to hear someone else say it. i wonder why she never told me right   out that dana was her ex? its not like i'm stupid and i wouldn't put it   together. alicia is iming me. . i haven't talke to her in a while. i   wonder how her friend fran is. she was cute. alicia says that she's   well and that nt hasn't changed. i don't miss it. or denton, really,   which makes me wonder why i'm going back there this weekend to   visit. i guess i just miss the people, but somehow i suspect that it   will be weird to see them. to be so removed from them for months,   it will all feel alien to me. i can't imagine myself there anymore. and   teaching today. . ugh. i'm not really looking forward to it. i'm afraid that   i won't remember my shit, that i won't be able to help these kids,   which is what i'm getting paid to do. its kind of silly to worry though,   after being surrounded by math and science for the past two years, i   hope that i'll remember something. and i'm hungry. it weird seeing   tamsters around school. its almost like they shouldn't be here. like   when you see random people in a dream that creep you out   because they don't seem like they should be allowed to invade your   mind. i'm not used to all this reading in school. i wish i had a   snickers. i'm used to math homework and bs like that, not actually   having to read and digest stuff like that. i like it, just not used to it. i   need to shower. i'm worried that i won't be able to finish this.

"i don't understand how it is i'm supposed to write this thing when i can't even type as fast as i can think. it's crazy because right now at this moment i am under pressure to think. at the same time i am trying to spell every thing correctly because i am a horrible speller. i have trouble with double letters in words. for instance tomorrow. is that right?  it's funny that someone who is supposed to be smart. i hate when people call me smart because i don't feel it. it's even wrong to say that i just work hard because i really don't. i was one of those loser high school kids that never studied and was only interested in class if there was some hard core discussion happening. my teachers never knew and neither did my parents because they always assumed i was studying hard. well they piss me off because they or rather my dad kicked me out because of stupid crap. i think it was because i never talked to them i hated talking to them. they were so bluh. i mean i talked about sports and politics and crap with my dad. but never anything serious that involved me. and my step mom lied to me about most of her life. telling me that she was so sweet and innocent as a young person but she actually had like 3 abortions and now she can't have kids. then when i got kicked out she tried to be all nice and stuff to me. people never i'm me and now that i am trying to write this thing everyone wants to talk to me. that's like when you are on the phone talking to someone you haven't talked to in a while all your friends start to call you or when you run out of minutes. i think it's a rip off to society how these stupid phone companies and internet providers make us pay. last month i had to pay $117 on that stupid cell phone. i didn't even realize i had talked that much on the thing. now i have lost my train of thought and have no idea what to write. can i cuss on this thing. i don't want to sound dumb or uneducated (which actually to some degree i'm not and early i did say i wasn't smart) does that make me crazy. i wonder if i can type stuff in another language. say for instance people who's first language isn't english like my boyfriend. i think he thinks in portuguese and then translates everything to english or maybe not i do that for spanish when i am trying to understand people but i can't speak it for the life of me but i can somewhat write it. and i normally understand it too. but i really want to learn it big time for when i become a doctor. i want to be a teacher too but i'm afraid because i'm like super mean and right now my hands are tired from writing and i really hate the fact that i keep up with my chemistry and this homework, but my pre-cal i dread. maybe because that loser assigned 80 discouraging problems. they are supposed to be really easy but the way he teaches confuses me and it really ticks me off. i think i'm just not going to go to class and just do the work on my own and ask my really smart friends who are in calculus right now if i run into a problem. but how hard can it be i took that crap in high school but i forgot it all because i never went for understanding just for the right answer. i am developing absolutely horrid study, sleeping, and everything else habits here. i don't even clean as often as i used to. i just want to be lazy and go out. i mean i never got to do that stuff when i was home because i dad was super strict. i never even got in trouble at school. not that that is to be rewarded because you're supposed to behave in school and make good grades. which i did. but i had a job and participated in sports and did well in them too. but my dad wanted too much he wanted me to be perfect and to not make mistakes. i'm not just exaggerating either. my grandparents not even his own mother understand why he did what he did. and he has explained why he kicked me out. it sucks because i have to pay for everything when i thought i had everything. sometimes life sucks big time but i'm not about to complain anymore because i'm still here and my grandparents are helping me and i am trying to help myself but i just get so tired sometimes. i want to keep writing but i'm supposed to do my pre-cal so i can go to target with heather at like five to spend money i don't have.

"hmm. writing assignment in psychology class. and here i was thinking that this class would be fun and exciting and relaxing, excluding any sort of writing assignment like the history or english classes. man i am making so many mistakes as i type, i couldn't possibly be nervous i know that for sure. oh look, what do you know, only about 1 minute and 30 seconds have gone by; i really don't know if i can keep this up for another 18 minutes or so. i wonder if grammar actually counts, not like i would receive any points on it if i wrote it any slower with a timer right on top of me anyway. hmm. think i will go back and read this message before i continue any longer. but, i guess that would kind of defy the purpose of writing in a stream of consciousness manner. stream of consciousness, that term reminds me of my humanities class in 9th and 10th grade. it definitely reminds of james joyce, the author of ulysses who attempted to write an entire book based on the method of stream of consciousness. man that was quite painful to read, since he didn't use any sort of punctuations at all. maybe i'm not supposed to be using any punctuations either. i wonder if i'm destroying the purpose of this experiment. writing this makes me wonder, can this really be stream of consciousness? there had to have been some premeditation involved one point of another. i'm beginning to feel like my thoughts are premeditated as well. heck, whatever gets me the credit and grades for this class. dr. pennebaker is one hilarious person, good at making fun of people. there is nothing better than public humiliation of individuals who like to stand out among his or her classmates. it is always a good laugh. well, friday's almost here, that means another week of my completely wasted college life has gone by. at least i get to go home for this weekend, i'm really sick of consuming the heinously disgusting american food at the jester buffet or city limits. i'm actually going home for business training. since i am an independent business owner, i should probably learn some management skills and as well as how to expand all the assets that i have. speaking of assets, i just recently learned the importance of being able to distinguish between what exactly is an asset and a liability. robert kiyosaki is a very, very intelligent man. i guess why he's the multi-millioinaire and i'm not. oh well, maybe i'll get to his place someday with the help of my friend. weird, what was i thinking. i could've sworn i was talkin about goin back home for business training earlier. i guess this is what stream of consciousness is all about huh. man, it seems like it's been forever, but only 10 minutes has gone by. speaking of time, it reminds me of the different theories that people have developed over their life time. some people thinks the time goes by faster if they stare at the clock. personally, i think the clock goes by so much quicker if i'm not constantly staring at it all the time. i wonder how many spelling mistakes i've failed to correct in this writing assignment, oh well. back to the business training, i hope the ninety dollars were well spent. i really hope that bww has put together somethin good this year, something that all the bww'quixtar-affiliated independent business owner can benefit from. man that was a pain to type, i probably should've just typed bww'quixtar ibo's for that matter. anyways, most of my friends don't seem to believe in the business that i'm participating in, well actually, owning. i don't really get any respect from them at all, and sometimes i really wonder why that is. the only thing i'm waiting to do now is being able to handle my business correctly, expand it large enough so i'll have multi-million dollar returns. and then i think i'm going to come back and laugh at all of the people that has disparaged the activity i was involved in. even better, the stupid electrical engineers that i call friends can work for me in the future. just as robert kiyosaki says,   an intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are to work for them.  i will be able to prove myself one day. being able to beat them down is probably the only drive or motivation that exists in my life. besides daisy of course, she is the love of my life. without her, i don't think i would've sanely passed through the toughest times of my life. i'm really hoping to get married to her one day, and make her the happiest woman on the face of this planet by providing her with everything that i possibly can. looks like i better get rich quick. but, i doubt she's interested in me being rich, i truly believe that she's with me today because it was her choice. she's not the type of person that would regret any decisions she has made in the field of love and relationships, which is something i really respect. she always gives her all, always tries to put on a smile just for me even though she may be having the worst day of her life. i'm so lucky that i've found her, and i'm willing to treasure this relationship for the rest of my life. i cannot really express my love for her in words, nor in sentences, maybe not even an essay of this length. all i can pray for is that someday, she will be able to touch my heart with her hands and fully understands the kind of appreciation that resides within the innermost side of my heart. i thank god everyday for all the things he has bestowed upon me. of course, besides eternal life, daisy is the next greatest gift that i have ever received. oh look, time's up, bye!

"trying to decide what to eat for dinner is complicated, especially when people don't answer the question. when you ask someone """"what do you want to eat?"""" most likely they will say, """"i don't know what do you want?"""" well, if i did know what i wanted to eat, i wouldn't have asked you. it is a simple question with a simple answer. right now i just asked my boyfriend what he wanted for dinner and his response was, """"i don't know whatever you want"""". well, that's why i asked you, i don't know what i want to eat, that's why i asked you. i guess that i wanted him to make the decision for me. i honestly don't know what i want to eat. it's a simple question and it's up to my stomach and brain to make that decision, but i'm asking someone to make this important decision for me. does this mean that i'm lazy because i want someone else to make a decision that i can only make for myself. maybe i'm not lazy; maybe it's just i want someone to help me make that decision. that seems logical, a person can't be lazy simply because he or she doesn't want to make a decision for themselves.

"what should i write about?. anything that pops into my head? okay. well, i have to write edwin email and via snail mail. i told him i'd send the pictures, his copies, of our trip to san antonio. that was one fun and exciting weekend. i miss him so much. i think of him as much as i do about jon. but jon more so, of course. i can't wait to see edwin again. mom's cooking really smells good. she's cooking filipino beefsteak and my mouth is watering. the watercolor picture on the front cover of the psycho text is quite unusual. looks like one of picasso's works, but the facial features aren't misplaced. hmmmm. how much more time do i have? eh, five minutes have passed. fifteen more minutes to go. i keep thinking about aol and the internet. i have to catch up with my email writing and afls posts. i rarely post in the newsgroup anymore. there are so many newbies and the people in there are rather annoying. lea posts there, though. that's really nice of her. very thoughtful lady. but what busts my buttons the most are the continuously unending flow of questions, personal or otherwise, that particular people tend to ask. they probably know more about lea than they do about themselves. they're so obsessed. i just want to tell them off and give them a piece of my mind, but i'm not that type of person. i like writing this way. it's like a diary or a journal of some sort. i should do this more often. it's quite relaxing. i used to keep a diary. i'd tell it everything, especially how i felt about edwin when i was younger. about 10 or 11 years old or so. i had the biggest crush on him, to this day, but he never knew back then. he liked me, too, big time. it was only a few weeks ago, when i saw him after 10 years that i confessed. we were both sad that we were never really together, but that night felt like we had been together all this time. for the longest time. it felt so natural  he said so himself. i could replay that weekend for the rest of my life. and we shared so many common interests that i never knew we had before. my, what a story we have. it's like a long lost love affair. this writing assignment is pretty neato. just writing down thoughts. putting it into words. i could write a whole novel. haha! i'm still thinking of edwin. but, alas, i am in love with someone else, also a boy from my childhood. i didn't really know him back when i was 10 years old. his family, yes, but not him. it's only during high school that i got to know him and later on fall head over heels for him. it wasn't love at first sight, you see, as in edwin's case. i eventually fell for jon and i will remain faithful and loving to him for as long as i shall live. should i end here? i've got one more minute. well, it's at least 20 minutes, but i feel like writing more. my mom's cooking smells great. well, time's up but i'll keep on writing. i need to go to the bathroom, too. so, until next time. this is confidential right? now, where's that submit button?

"at the moment, i am tired. i just woke up a little while ago, and i'm writing. i can't stand writing. i don't mind the work. it's just that writing doesn't come naturally to me. i was wondering the other day, if college was reall going to change me into the genius i expect to be. i mean, when i get out into the career world, will i know """"everything"""" i need to know about my job? will i have to know everything? will there be room for training and learning? confusion! i guess its not a bad thing, but to be confused is embarrasing. i guess what i'm really getting at is without confusion life would be absolutely tedious. as i sit here in my apartment, closed off from society, i can't help but realize how much i miss my family back home. although college is my main priority and the fact that i don't care what anyone thinks about me, i can't help but wonder if my family thinks i can make it or not, if i have what it takes. that is always in my mind somewhere. i, myself, know i can make it. i know i have what it takes to succeed. however, when i do graduate and get a career job, is that it? is that going to be my life until i retire. i am very spontaneous and i won't be able to stand getting into a daily routine. i stopped writing for a second to gather my thoughts and i read the assignment again. i have no earthly idea how my mind works or why it works like it does. i'm not a scientist and i don't care to be. i just want to be happy.

"i don't know what to write about really and i have a bunch of other things on my mind. i haven't eaten breakfast yet and i'm pretty hungry, but i fear that if i don't do this now i might never get around to doing it. the assignment doesn't seem to be that difficult, but sometimes i have trouble thinking of things to say. i'm not going to my calculus study session because i think it will mainly be review of what i have already learned in high school. my roommates friend henry just called and somewhat interrupted my thoughts. i don't think my roommate likes henry very much but i don't know that for sure. he always calls when my roommate isn't here which to me is a signal that they're not really in sync. when i feel most confident about my relationships with others is generally when we're in sync with each other. i think that the more time you spend with a person the more you become somehow linked to that person. i've been waiting to read a book for some time now and my friend just finished and gave it to me. i think everyone should read ain't nobody's business if you do: the absurdity of consensual crimes in our free country by peter mcwilliams. not only is it a very controversial book, but it is also humorous and very informative and educational. peter mcwilliams has aids, cancer, and was using marijuana for medicinal purposes under california state law, but was arrested and thrown in jail. i agree with mcwilliams 100% about consensual crime being ridiculous and i think it's wrong that he's in jail now. i got fined $15 recently for parking in lot a67 next to jester. the parking and traffic administration expects me to park on the other side of red river, or better yet i35. i think this is stupid and am very upset with this,  i plan on writing a letter of complaint to david kapalko. my parents finally came to their senses and bought me a computer for school. that is one of the main reasons i am able to do this assignment now. i didn't feel comfortable writing these kind of personal thoughts in a computer lab full of other people. my parents got a good computer for a low price and now i can work from my dorm room, so i think everyone is satisfied. i just wonder if having a computer will be another hindrance to meeting new people especially girls. not that there aren't plenty of girls that use computers, but i don't really get out enough as it is. i know it's up to me to make the effort but i almost feel trapped in a situation where i don't meet enough girls or hang around them enough.

"it's hard to believe that my first year of college has begun. it's almost like i am at summer camp for a week, and i will be returning home in a week. however, that is just a false reality in my head. it's hard for me to grasp everything. it seemed to happen so fast. i left behind my family, my friends, my cheerleading squad, my town. everything that is familiar has been traded in for a world of experience and confusion. what time is my next class? where is my next class? where is everyone going tonight? it's mass confusion in my head. i want to be successful at college: academically, spiritually, emotionally and physically. i have already begun a steady workout and eating habits that make me feel good about my self, and so far i have enjoyed all of my classes. however, there's still that little thought in the back of my head that i am not getting everything done. i feel like there's this list of things to do all the time and no matter what i do, i will never get them done. i have to admit, my first week of college was completely awful. i hated every moment of it. i cried everyday, called my mom, acted like a real baby. it was as if there was this strike against me that made sure nothing went my way. but as i have gotten used to the schedule and made a few new friends things seem to be looking up. i still feel like i don't fit in. this miniature """"society"""" at the university of texas is like a town within itself, and all of the citizens in this """"town"""" seem so superficial. i don't feel like i have met anyone with one natural thought in his or her head. i can't believe how strange it is. it's as if the whole campus is full of sorority girls and fraternity guys. (no offense, it's just not me) i want to feel like a part of things but for the life of me i can't get in """"the loop. """" i make a few friends here and there, but as far as personalities, i feel like i am too real for everyone i have met. i am hoping that by next semester i will begin to make this dorm room my home and the people around me my family. it's not so much that i am homesick as it that i just miss fitting in. back in high school there were no worries. everything was laid out for you; only a few minor decisions to be made. i fit in so well. i knew my way around, i knew what was going on at all times; it was like a utopia in my little town of sugar land, tx. the only problem with the whole """"high school thing"""" is that i was definitely a stereotype. (another superficial moment in my life) i was a cheerleader all through high school. people at my school assumed i was a snobby, selfish girl who only thought the world of myself as well as my other cheerleader friends. they never even got the chance to know me. i can say right off- i am far from snobby. i love everyone and everything in this world. i am out to harm no one, except my self emotionally every once in a while! why do teenagers feel the need to be so judgmental of each other? why is it that i can't drive my mustang convertible in my cheerleading uniform without feeling like i am straight out of a """"saved by the bell"""" episode? i am thinking that over time, an image has been created in everyone's mind on how things should be, and how people should look. who is to say who and what we are? why do i feel like i am always answering to someone? i can't make a decision without someone loving it and someone else hating it. i hate the fact that the media has pounded into our brains what and who we should be. this is real life people. when you are doled out your genes-physical and personality-you don't get a choice. some people honestly can't help the way they are. so why do we take the time to stop and make them feel even worse about their insecurities? i think the answer is within our own insecurities. it's sick that people feel better about themselves after putting someone else down. if a girl thinks she has ugly hair, she may announce that """"that girl over there"""" has a horrible sense of fashion. does that take away from the fact that she has ugly hair? i don't think so! so why has it become so necessary to step on whomever it takes to make you look better? my mind is full of these questions. i just know that as long as i am here, i plan to stay the real, down to earth girl that i am, as to not become a victim of my own insecurities.

"     ok. just got done crying because of stupid high school people i never want to talk to again. the shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal. i hope i don't misspell too many things. i am sniffingly so loud. i should go get a tissue. i never did learn how to type right on this thing. why did my thoughts just totally flip?  wow, that's weird. brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics. i really wish i could concentrate for more than 2 seconds when i'm emotional. it really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until i can see straight. but i won't be crying any more hopefully as i am cutting off those jerks from high school. i don't need than, nor do i wan them in any aspect of my life. they just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me. wow, london tell them how you really feel!  i hate computers when i have fake nails. i always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done. my back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground. i think it's time to switch positions. ah. much better. now my typing skills really stink. it's really hard to lay on the ground and type. oh i have a laptop. that would be stupid to do if i had a regular pc. i still can't get comfortable. the floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed. that's better. i don't know why i didn't get on the bed in the first place. ahhh!!  yes, i do i don't want to be on my white comforter!!  oh no!!  you know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be. you would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me. stupid back gives me problems all the time. i miss dr. jones!!  i don't know how i'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever i hurt. it just occurred to me that i might be using aim abbreviations in this writing thing. that might not make me look too smart. oh, well. i don't want to go back and look at it. it would just take to long. god, my nose is still stopped up. my skin is drying out to. i need to wash my face and moisturize. i forgot how to spell moisturize!!!  i had to retypr it like three times. you know for someone who is supposed to be smart, i am pretty dumb sometimes. i wonder if pennebaker thought i was dumb in class today. i zoned out a little bit and then raised my hand and said something that did not fit with what he was looking for. i wish i could just leave all the bad behind me, then maybe i could pay attention in class. but no. i have to be all sensitive and worry about everyone and everything that someone else should be caring about. i seriously need to just be tough and tell people to back off me. i was going to use a bad word, but i don't know if that would be appropriate. i wonder if it would affect my grade if i did write a cuss word. is that how you spell cuss?  maybe i should have just wrote curse. and why do i always have to fix the word just?  every time i type just without paying close attention i put an extra j in between the u and the s. it makes me feel quite stupid. time just ran out. i'm glad because i want to just go to sleep and forget about people  i will never have to see again.

"i am so exhausted. these last few weeks since school has started has worn me out. i have pretty much no energy, and i got ten hours of sleep last night. my brain is also exhausted from all the partying i have been doing since i got here. i can't wait for tonight. i am going to club elements, and i am going be wasted. i love techno music. it is so awesome. it is crazy how a dj can put all sorts of different beats together at once and make it sound so perfect. i could listen to techno music all day long. i am listening to techno music right now. every time i hear techno music it makes me want to dance and have a good time. anyways, i hope texas kicks some ass on saturday. i love watching ut play football and tear it up. college football is the best sport in the world to watch. my other favorite team to watch in college is michigan. my dad went there so i have been a true michigan fan ever since i was little. i even went to the rose bowl in 1997 when they played washington state. they won and michigan ended the season undefeated and number one in the nation. in choosing the college that i wanted to go to, it was a choice between michigan and ut. my brother graduated from ut a few years ago and i really looked up to him greatly as a kid. i finally decided to follow my brother and go to ut. so far i feel it was a great choice. austin is an awesome city that fits well with my personality. i decided that if i want to continue my studies and get a masters degree, then i will probably go to michigan for that. right now, that is my plan for the next seven or eight years of my life. however, i really don't know what exactly i want my major to be. anyways, off of that subject, there are so many fine girls here. everywhere i look there is another girl that i want a piece of. i t is awesome. i have never seen so many hot chicks in my life. the whole experience of living down here so far has been awesome. i can do whatever i want, whenever i want. and it is great living far away from home. nothing beats coming in at five in the morning and not having to hear my mom or dad bitch at me. actually, my parents were very good parents and usually let me have my space. they learned after the first two kids what it is like parenting kids, so they were pretty loose with me. i really do kind off miss my parents. they are very good people who gave me a lot during my stay at home and they would do anything for me. they have always been there for me even when i have been in trouble with authorities and other high officials. not that i was a bad teenager or anything, but i think everyone who likes to party a lot, like me, have had their share of conflict with the cops. anyways, twenty minutes is up, so bye.

"     i am waiting for brad to get home. i hope that he's talking to michael because they need to figure out what's happening before things get worse. i can't believe he's being so petty about this whole ordeal. seriously, was he expecting us to pat him on the back and say how proud we are that he's started smoking pot. . not just a little either. . but massive amounts?  i don't quite understand how on earth he can simply think that just because he's been on medications and is immune and he's sick and is in pain that that is a valid excuse. we all have our issues to escape from, while i'll agree that yes none of us face exactly what he's going through with his disorders and his back, we have our problems too. i hate to see him like this, feeding himself bs to justify it. he knows it was wrong, i honestly think he knows its wrong and he claims he regrets it but deep down i don't think he does. this is his rebellion. what kills it the most is that it shows just how hypocritical he can be. maybe a year ago he was bashing one of his really good friends for doing something so similar. . the guilt trips, the icq away messages, the finger pointing. its all the same. i know thats what scares brad so much about it, because michael is his best friend, and he can't stand to see him turn into benny. neither can i. i've known one too many people who end up permenately stoned so bad that they can't remember anything past the last fix. its so sad to watch them as they stop being able to function. i know, just know that one of these days i'm going to get a call from someone saying that one by one they're dying off. its so sad. some of my best friends have become drug addicts and have nearly lost their lives because of it, and yet they continue to use it. now they might as well be dead. . they have no personality and they'll never be the same people they once were. drugs make you petty. they've all become petty. i worry how this effects brad. he's right, michael basically is his only friend, guy friend anyway. if michael were to hold this against him it would definately kill him and would seriously screw with his future. brad has a hard time making friends. i'm actually incredibly surprised we're even together conisdering his track record. he's the shyest drama major i've ever met. he won't talk to people. i have to talk for him sometimes, and he gets upset if i don't introduce him. most people know who he is, they just don't believe me. when i talk about him i talk about either why he's got me frustrated or how great he is, and when he meets my friends nothing. . he sits there and stares. he promises he'll try and its not something i hold against him. . yes it kind of annoys me but i seriously don't hold it against him. marked up as one of his quirks. i have so many i guess i can't really hold his agianst him since he doesn't hold mine against me. i can't believe that michael would hold a grudge. . he's always gotten so mad at me for having my grudges since last year and always lectured me and i've listened and tried not to hold what they did to me against them, that whole christian turn the other cheek forgiveness thing. i'm trying. . honestly i am. but i must admit life is so much easier when i don't have to be around them. no constant reminder of all the stuff that happened last year. its a new chapter in my life and its so great that although they followed me here, they don't have to be a part of it. i just want brad to be happy. the old michael wouldn't have had this problem, but he's changed recently, and definatley not for the better. almost makes me feel the need to return the favor. just as they controled and manipulated and abused me last year, he is their victim now, and it makes me so sad. he's a great guy. he just should have taken his own advice and gotten out of there as fast as he could. trevor would have understood, and if he's anything like they claim, he definately would not approve of the life his friends have chosen. drugs won't bring him back. he died its time for all of them to move on. i just don't know if they'll ever realize that. some won't ever . . i wonder if we can make micael see that before its too late.

"well, today was ok in te beginning, i met lucy for our first class and we sat together we pretty much spent most of the day together i just didn't realize how easy it was to spend time with someone new. she is just someone who's easy to get a long with  but after walking around campus for a million years we came to jester to check out the learnsing skills center and there was so much stuff there to help us study and do homework for cal and chem. the lady there was so nice and helpful, the trip was really worthwhile. i tried to buy stamps from the vending machine, but it just wouldn't take my money. i had to go back and forth too many times. finally i bought some out of the other machine where i didn't get ot chose which stamps i wanted which kinda pissed me off. then we went to dobie to visit karen and christy. while we were there i had fun. but then my ankle started hurting a lot and i guess i just walked on it too much. we went to eckerds to get my pictures and a lot of them look good. i was kinda mad that the pictures of the flowers and such i took got messed up and i can't retake them. oh well. i was kinda scared walking all the way back to kinsolving because ppl could see my injured ankle and someone could've just come up and assaulted me. at the time, i was kinda hoping someone would cause there's just so much stuff here that's depressing. when i got home, i was about to cry cause i was thinking again about how no one comes over here to visit me. i mean, who are my real friends (that is if i have any) they're so lazy they can't even come over here to visit. no one really calls me either. i just don't know how to describe it cause i know if i really wanted to talk to them i could just call, but well, no one really calls me. it's just frustrating cause while erin's out all these ppl always call and when she's over she's on the phone so much and she goes out every night. i know i don't need to go out and be on the phone all the time, it's just that it's really lonely not hving anyone over here all the time to keep me company. maybe if erin and i were more talkative or she was home more often. i don't know, it's just weird. what am i supposed to do about stanley? i mean, i actually would've gotten into a relationship with  him even though i know it'd just be physical, but sometimes that's what i need. the touch of someone who cares. but i guess stanley doesn't really care. he just was thinking of himself and how he needed to satisfy his urges. it's not fair! it's not fiar at all that i have to be here alone when i see so many ppl on the outside who have b'f and g'f and they don't really look like they deserve them. i don't know where to go f' here cause i feel so lonely a lot and no one can really understand how i feel. crying right now. i don't even feel as though god understands or can hear how troubled i am. i just wish that there was someone who really cared, someone who'd always be here for me. but it's like i can't really count on anyone. everyone has their own life. and it's always about them. i don't like being alone. if i just killed myself, i could end all this, but i don't want to. but i do. i need to find out what the future will be like. even if i never find someone who appreciates me, if i can just somehow find some happiness. just a little. go one day where i don't cry or think about being lonely. just a little something. it's not fair. what do i do? it's hard to go on each day trying to endure the battles that come with  each day. trying to face the hardships. if only i could do what i really wanted to do. scrapbooks and drawing and painting have money to do what i wanted to. build my dream house. design it, oversee the construction. one day. that's my dream. to have a wonderful house to live in. where i can go to find myself at peace. a weight room, sauna, spa, pool, greehouse, huge living room with  a giant entertainment center, huge bedroom and bath, huge windows. a painting art room, dojo, so many things i want to do. but i don't know if that will bring me happiness. how am i supposed to be happy if i can't share the big house with  someone i love. someone who loves me back. loves me as much as i love them. it's hard to think of what love is when i think that i've been there, and not been able to feel the same f' the other person. what am i doing here anyway?? there's nothing for me now. i'm so alone. alone in this room with  no one calling me, asking me to do anything. what kind of friends do i have? no one is as considerate as me or maybe as sensitive as me. i just don't like being alone. if someone wanted to ask me out, in desperation. like donald said, being in love with  the thought of being in love. maybe that's what i've been in with  anthony. but i really thought he was the one. the one i could spend my life with . will i ever be able to fine someone to end my loneliness?

"right now i'm thinking about the situation i am going through with my two roommates. school has just started and it looks like we will soon be at each others' throats. i really hope we can find a way to not get on each others' nerves because we are such good friends. i'm also thinking about my life and the new frontiers i am beginning to encounter. i can't stop thinking about how the next four years of my life are going to turn out. i hope everything is as great as everyone says it is and has been. i also miss my mom very much. even though i don't talk to her everyday on the phone, i can hear speaking to me with her heart. the same thing goes for me too. my classes and keeping a responsible daily routine are at the top of my priority list right now. i don't want anything to interfere with me doing an exceptional job in all of my courses. it really is a big change for me being here at a university. back home school was a breeze. now i can actually feel that i'm going to have to study, which will be a first for me. the good side to that is that i like challenges. one of my friends from back home, who is really close to me, is planning to move to florida. there isn't anything wrong with that because he's """"in love"""". i hope that he's making the right decision with the move and with her. i really care about him and i wouldn't want him to get hurt in any way. although, i have a strange feeling that she might be the one for him. either way he always has a lucky star just waiting to fall on him so that somewhat takes away a bit of my worriness. my other friends who are very close to me are still in my hometown going to school over there. i miss them all the time but i know that me being here is the best thing for me. for some reason i can't stop thinking about a girlfriend of mine who lives in san antonio because she is attending st. mary's university. there has always been an unspoken romance between us but we have never actually been together because we have never brought it up, but we know that something is there.

"     i thought that this writing assignment was going to be difficult, but it's actually not that bad. actually, i kind of like it. it's kind of like writing a diary or journal. i feel hungry right now and am wondering what i am going to eat for lunch. i am tired of eating the same food at jester again. the food there is always the same: pizza, chicken, burgers, etc. i can't wait until i go home to dallas this afternoon and eat some real authentic vietnamese food. i miss my mom's cooking. just a few more hours and i'll be on my way back to dallas. i can't wait!  i miss my boyfriend so much. his birthday's coming up and i still need to get him a present. i don't know what to get him. it's hard for me because i don't have a car at ut. i wondering what he's doing right now can't wait to see his face. my friend just burned a new dj cd that just released and some of the songs are actually ok but a lot of it is not that good. i miss my family. its funny how when i'm at home i wish that i was away from home because my family tend to annoy and get on my nerves at time, but when i'm actually away i wish i was home. my roommate just finished talking to this guy she's dating. he calls her a lot. it's funny because that's how it was with me and my boyfriend when we were 'talking. '  he would call me all the time. my friends are studying in my dorm right now. i feel so lazy. i'm behind in a lot of classes and i havn't been doing a lot of studying this week. i need to push myself to study before i screw up my gpa again. speaking of school, it's only my second year in college and i wish that it would over. i mean i like college and all like the friends you meet, the parties, and the school spirit. i just hate classes and studying. my friend is singing right now and it's so hilarious because he has a monotone voice and when he sings you can't tell that he has a monotone voice and when he sings its like he gives it his all. its so funny. by the way the dj cd that we burned is called dj prada g. it's like the dj is trying to make his name unique like making it sound like 'prodigy' but spelled differently. hmmm. twenty minutes sure is going by slow. i have an ortho appointment this monday so i'm going to miss calculus which is'nt too bad because i can borrow the notes from my friend. i need to go shopping this weekend; i am so out of clothes to wear. five more minutes. this assignment isn't too bad. when are we going to eat?  i need to start packing. i am such a procrastinator, i wait till the last minute for everything. i need to stop that. i wondering what my boyfriend's friends are going to do for his birthday this weekend. i have a feeling that they are going to get him drunk. we are about to leave for dallas soon since one of my friends decided not to go, so we don't have to wait for her. when are we going to eat?

"i'm still trying to figure out why i always procrastinate. i think i like to work under pressure, i have a philosophy paper due in a couple hours. i wonder if this class is going to be hard, or easy as long as you read and listen. i hope the second because i have never been one to study, and i would prefer not to now. why do people go home on the weekends? i thought that was what college is all about, going out on your own, more independence. calculus is going to be difficult this semester, i can already tell i'm going to have to do the homework in there. microecon shouldn't be too bad, i already covered most of the material in high school. if there's one thing in life i want to accomplish it is to understand what girls think, and what they mean by what they say or by their actions. i'm hoping this class well help me in that pursuit. its like you could be best friends, always hanging out have a great time, and think there's something there, but she just is gone for a while then. i'm still interested in this sleep deprivation thing. i read that some guy did an experiment on himself and stayed awake for over a hundred hours. after that everyone he saw he thought was satan or the grim reaper or something like that. i think that would be an interesting experience to have, hallenacion and what not. i hope bush wins the election, although my family is die hard republican, i am more agree with things from both sides, with a slight lean to republican. i just believe bush will do a lot better job than kerry, and the whole vietnam thing i just don't was right. its funny how people can overreact and stereotype. there is currently a couple of bills in congress trying to resurrect the draft for military and civil service. while i don't know everything about it, i was looking over it and it appears to be supported by democrats. and the people i heard about it from were complaining that bush was the one that is trying to do it. i just hate it when people don't get their facts straight before they try and argue things, it just makes them look stupid. poker is a fun little game. i wish i could play it more often. trying to read people, and make decisions based on their actions and words. i wish i could find a girlfriend. there are many beautiful girls down here, but i don't know about some of them. there was this awesome beautiful girl at home, but i don't really know what happened there, i guess that goes back to understand what is going on in a woman's brain. i realized 20 minutes is a lot longer than you think it is, or maybe it is just appearing to be longer because i am thinking about how long it is, or i'm not doing an activity i find to be exciting. figuring a person out by the music they listen to is a fun activity. its hard because some people listen to all types of music. coffee is a life saver, going to sleep at 4 or5 then having class at 8 the next morning is not fun, i'm surprised i woke up for it. i missed class the other day when i slept through it and it was at 12. that's just strange, getting up at the 8 one, but oversleeping the 12. i wonder what the real world has in store for me, no more school and someone there to help. but as one professor i met said, remember these days, these are heaven. because after school you are going into hell. which i would agree with although i haven't experienced life after school, but i think it will be hell.

"i am so down in the dumps right now because i have just broken off  a two year relationship. i seriously  hope i didn't just throw away the best relationship i ever had or will have. i can't help but feel slightly unattractive right now because mark has already started to get over me quite well and reid and eric don't treat me the way they used to. i don't understand why people can't simply be honest about the way they feel. i probably have spent half of my life wondering what everyone else was thinking. i t is such a waste of time. if i saw a girl and she seemed really nice, i don't see why i couldn't just go up to her and be like, """"hi""""  and  guys won't ever meet a girl with the intention of gaining a friend. the whole process is so much more exasperating than it seems worth at times. the friends i have now are my good friends. i just instantly clicked with them. there wasn't any of this trying not to seem overly eager to hang out with you bullshit that usually goes along with the turf of making new  friends. that's sort of why i resent plano i guess. the stupid system and expectations they have totally just messed me up in the head. i don't have nay self-confidence. it is hard to feel like you are somebody in a class of 1500. i wasn't good at any sports, or at least not good enough to play there. so why did i come to a school with 50000 people full of clicks just like it was in high school?  i will probably be perpetually putting on the front of self-confidence and self-assuredness. that's what sucks about the world. everybody just bullshits everyone else. people are so insincere and self-serving. i know i am. there are so many rules that govern the group that you belong to. you can't wear what you want or anything. i am not saying that i don't like the way that i look but every now and then it would be cool to go out in what i want to wear  or whatever and i could know that people weren't  talking about  it behind my back. looking at my thoughts on screen makes me so ashamed of them. i'm nit a bad person. i just kive up to every part of the whole greek system that ever gave it a bad name. rush is such a load of crap. everyone acts like they know or care who you are. it all turns out to be the same people in the same crowds that they ran around with in high school. i wish the rest of the work wasn't like this too. but i guess is doesn't matter where you go because it will always be the same old bullshit. pretty girls date the cutest boys who have the good luck to bring home the big bucks to raise their kids in an upper middle class lifestyle. so it goes. kurt vonnegut really knew what was up. that's why i like him because he doesn't preach all this """"the sun will come up tomorrow crap""""  he knows that if the sun comes up tomorrow you will probably get a really bad sunburn and die of skin cancer in the end. i hope mark doesn't meet any girls at this party i just don't want it to be too late to have him back once i get this whole lifestyle change thing out of my system.

"twenty minutes seems like a long time. it amazes me how weird time is. like when you're sitting in a plane waiting to get off and it seems like hours, but it's only minutes. i spend alot of time on planes. my dad is a pilot. i fly free. i don't know what i will do after college, because then i don't fly free anymore. i won't be able to go anywhere whenever. my roommate is in the shower. she has a sorority thing tonight. i'm not in a sorority. i'm glad, it's not the place for me. a guy died in my hometown last weekend. i t was strange, because my roommate had just commented on deaths happening in threes, and mother theresa and princess diana had just died. i didn't know the guy at all, but still, that could have been anyone. i think about that a lot. death. like what if someone died that i knew, but i had never told them what they mean to me. that's selfish, i know, but that's what we are, we're selfish. we as in humans. a friend of mine in my psych class knew the guy who died. i like country music, but most people don't. i just started liking it last year, because my boyfriend at the time got me hooked on it. my back hurts. i like to rub people's backs. i wish someone was here to rub mine. tonight i'll be alone in the dorm. i like that sometimes everyone just gets on your nerves. my roommate and i knew each other in high school. we have gotten along amazingly well so far. knock on wood. i have never been in a car accident, when i was driving. my brother messed up his knee in a car accident. i like this song. he had to have his acl ligament redone. he can be such a baby. i think men have an amazingly low pain tolerance. i really think that they just aren't as well equipped for pain. that's just a personal opinion. i give lots of personal opinions. people tell me i'm opinionated. i don't like people who can't discuss their opinions and thoughts. it's important to be able to communicate. i'm a speech major. my undergrad advisor is great. i met him at orientation, and i love him. he tells you exactly what he thinks and that is so important. i don't like this song. it's one of those depressing love songs that is so typical of country. i wonder if i'll get married. i think i want to, but not kids. i do not want kids. that's another one of my opinions. how can we bring a child into this world?  so then people ask me if  i wish i hadn't been born. two completely different concepts. anyway, i'm gonna call my aunt holly. she is like a second mother to me. i live my mother. she really is my lifeline. that's a scary thought, like could i survive without her?  of course, she raised my to be a survivor. i love basketball. my mom and i watch games together all the time. the rockets are my favorite team. i also like dennis rodman. but i hat e the bulls. rodman always says what he is thinking. some people think he's a little tooo crazy, but i love it. h breaks the mold. that's commendable in my book. i miss my cousins. one of them is a big basketball fan. he and i always talk basketball. i'm almost done, twenty minutes did not take as long as i thought it would. i really like this song. i'm finished!!

"     well it is about 1:20 in the morning and i have been up studying for a few of my classes. i keep weird hours on my classes rather than try and make time for them during the day. i guess i enjoy my leisure time as well as my study and i try and make time for both on the weekends. i almost feel like i should have a big sign in my room somewhere saying   hey you should be studying something!   ha. . well maybe not but i like to keep atop of my studies and i don't want to slack off on any of my assignments. the joy i get from lounging around is multiplied by ten if i fall behind on an assignment or if i feel that i might get a   b   or   c   on a test rather than an   a  . i like the fact that i know i will get what i deserve out of my class by what i put into it. so because of this i try and make sure to do the studying. right now my grades are very important to me. i feel that in the long run they will distinguish me from all the other people who are just trying to get thru college and then maybe find themselves in life. where as i have already gone the route of finding and exploring myself as well as rationalizing the things i do for quite sometime now. my success i know will not just depend on my degree or simply finishing college but also many other things that i feel i might be able to control. understanding the aspect of control early on or trying to get a grasp on my life made me realize that there really is no control on life. you must prepare yourself for the best that life has to offer while along the way being happy in the process. right now it is to be the best that i can be and to get the things i want. so in order for me to do that i must do well in school and in business. my happiness is might be put off alittle right now by my 15 hours of school but the sacrifice to myself will pay off in the end. it makes me wonder who really is going to read this and what you must be thinking at this point. ha. . what a character. well no not really just a determined man. i like doing things that people have told me i had no chance in doing. when i moved here from colorado i had an agenda and for the last 3 years i have checked off everything that i have set out to do. it gives me comfort in doing what most people can only dream of and never make the attempt or the sacrifice to get it. blink. blink. don't know. . haha. . feeling the affects of sleep deprivation right now. . my eyes are feeling alittle heavy and the distant sound of a car alarm is making my mind drift. i see soft white cotton pillows floating around in the back of my mind with baby blue sheets. man i need to get some sleep. i took this writing assignment as a challenge to be honest and type whatever came into my mind and i guess that this is what i am doing exactly to the   t  . many different things keep up at night, school, my grandmother in the hospital, the different appointments that i have at school and the week coming up about 9'11. wondering if my grandmother will be around then and if she is what state of mind will she be in. which is wrong for me to say seeing as how she just had a stroke and part of her brain is not functioning. the doctors say that she does not feel a thing. i really would like to believe them. it seems unfair that she should live this long (92 years) only to be let to die a little every day. the doctors say that she has a strong heart for age. . well hell we have always known that. . but this one time i wish it was not so strong. . i miss her laughter and knowing that her mental capacity was just as strong as her heart. i miss her already even though i know that she is still with us. bright red eraser. . why did they make them that color? why not white or blue or yellow on the end of pencils? it seems to me maybe it is the properties of how they make erasers that cause it to be the color that it is. trying to stay with the typing and trying not to drift off. . i was hoping to get another experiment done after this one but i think that maybe i might try and sleep. i have got to get up earyl and get one of my vehicles registered down town. maybe that is part of this writing experiment. have us write this with the knowing that eventually we will turn it into something that we know or think that someone will read. so when we write we eventually get to that point of writing. the mind is laying out a thought process or maybe it is all just random and i am thinking out loud with my keystrokes. i read somewheres that in a thousand years the english language will be dead and that new ways are being created to keep individuals away from any toxic or harmful waste that might be around. so they are trying to create a visual sign for them that will be some kind of universal signal for danger or trouble or death. hmmm. . seems weird that in time our language might go the way of the egyptians. . times up. . night.

"you know, this is sort of a bizzare assignment. you would think that one would just start listing off a bunch of items like  dog, cat, mouse. etc. however, it that was the case, would there be some sort of indication of what the persons mind was filled with?  maybe. maybe not. so i essence in reflecting on the kind of determination that can be made from something like this leaves one in kind of a quandry. let's see the desk i'm sitting at is hard. it's wooden, so why not?  i'm in a library so aside from the loud typing noise i and others like me are making. all is quiet. you know, speaking of quiet, that is another thing that comes to mind. as i was reading an   e-card   sent to me by my wonderful girlfriend just minutes ago, i was unable to trully get a whole and complete apreciation of them due to this surrounding silence. allow me to explain. as i am obligated by the nature of this assignment to just contimuously spit out thought as they come to me. it limits the amount of organization of said thoughts. anyway, so i assume that whoever is in charge of these convinient little computer stations in the library, has taken it upon themselves to make sure all the volume controls have been pre set to a level of zero. you know. a library. concentration etc. so i guess that's not really volume control at all is it?  well, at least no control for the common user such as myself. control to the administrator or whatever. so back to the oriinal point of the e-card. these little messages provided by different. providers i guess wouldbe the first thing that comes to mind usually have some sort of audio accompinament (sp). now, reiterating the fact that all the volumes control has been taken away from me and others like me, i literally could not hear an of what was going on. that was unfortunate. quite. so i guess i'm going to have to find some other place to enjoy to it's full potential what was intended to be read as well as heard. that is kind of a round-a-bout way to say that i was unsatisfied with the events that unfolded in regards to the   all silent   rule in libraries. i had never really thought about that side of it before. of course there have been an uncountable amount of times that i've sat in a library and truly enjoyed the silence that it provides. . always just thinking that that is the way it should be. silent. no noise. i always envisioned some nasty old librarian with some kind of   sonar   hearing just out to bust the hidden conversations wherever they inevitably pop up throughout the establishment. of course there's always the issue of the cellular phones. oh, man- have we gone nuts with the phones!!! what is the deal with that!?  has it truly come to the point that p person is in such need to be in contact with everyone and anyone that they have to be totally and at everyone's disposal. is there something that pressing for everyone?  i really wonder. i know there are those buisness men and women that just depend on that kind of continual interaction with . whoever they interact with. i guess i just have a hard time relating because there just is not that scenario in my life. in fact i would go so far as to say that i would be very uncomfortable to be that availabel all the time. i mean that would put me in a very akward position. always with someone wanting something. someone calling. someone bugging. ahhhhhh that just drives me crazy even thinking about it. there's something funny i just remembered. it's in the out takes from some movie with jackie chan and ohh what's his name. i can't remember. that black guy from friday. o chris tucker. so they're in some scene and it was obvious that chris tucker had forgotten his line or at least that's the way it seemed and then out of nowhere his cell phone rings. just like that!  here they are- rolling that expensive 35 millimeter film and the man is talking on his phone. he says somthing like:    no man, i can't talk right now. we're shooting. yea man. right now. i'm standing right here with jackie chan. .   it went on for a couple more seconds and the guy wouldn't believe tucker and as it went on . jackie was getting frustrated. chris tucker had to prove it to his friend that he really was shooting so he gave the phone to jackie who said hey, we can't talk now. in his oriental accent. it  was funny.

"the crotheres computer lab is perhaps one of the worst on campus, but i don't really know since i have been to only three. i'm real glad that i got into the college of communications. its unfortunate, however, that i can't spell worth anything. jeez, i hope this writing assignment is not graded on spelling or grammar or any of that sort of nonsense. why is it oh so hot in here? honestly, every other building on campus is freezing, but in here, i just want to wear beach clothes. i remember when i went to the beach for the first time in my life. it was this past summer. myrtle beach. oh family vacations. i hope my mom and pop are doing ok at home. since i'm gone they only have each other to yell at. no more marjon for yell fest 2004 at the rostami household. good people. they just need to get out more. this keyboard kind of sucks too. some of the keys get suck and it is oh so inconvenient. there we go with the spelling again. in the eighth grade my english teacher once told me that spelling is not a sign of a gifted student. at the end of the year she gave me the award for best student. yep. english has always been a good one. i hope i make the staff of the daily texan. they emailed me today and told me that i had to write another column. can't they tell just how amazing i am from only one column? i guess not. i need to be more creative. creative like all those communication kids. i'm one too!!! yayayay! yes sir, all the cool kids are communications majors. at orientation a radio station person told me i was a cool kid. this city makes my face break out big time. my skin is horrible, and i hate having to scratch  my skin when my fingers have been typing and i most obviously have contracted all sorts of bacteria that i am now rubbing on my face. oh my face. the communications kids i interviewed with today (the texan) had bad skin too. i think i'll fit in swell with them. if i just get in. oh man oh man oh manoh man. i really hope i make the staff. i find out on thursday. i also have to submit another column by thursday. i had a teacher once who had really long nasty nails and a nose ring (those weren't common until a few years ago. then everyone started getting them, including white kids. i am white. my people are from the caucus mountains and you just don't get any more caucasion than and iranian. again with the spelling. and again with the messed up keys. i should have just gone to use the computers in the ugl or the cma or cmc, whichever one has computers. i thought not having a computer would be a major hassle, but it is pretty decent so far. knock on wood! my hands are dry. that's another think about this city, it makes my skin dry. maybe that's why my skin is breaking out so hardcore-because it is so dry that it is producing more oils to balance out my skin tone but it just proves to be detrimental to my skin. oh shoot. i never cared about my appearance. i was the homecoming queen. me. not some """"popular slut. """" man, there are so many sorority girls in this school. at the beginning of school i mistakenly walked through the area in front of the ugl and walked through a mass of girls who all looked the exact same!! where is your identity little girl? they have none. my phone just vibrated. it could be my mom. she calls a lot now that my sister and i are out of the house all she has to talk to is my pop, and well, he is not one to talk. lame. or it could be some fool from my high school warning me of the fat pagan. i hate her, if it is one person who i hate it is jenny pagan: my theatre teacher for 4 years and i had her twice a day. yuck! jesus i hate her. i'm going back home on the 24th to crown the new queen and i might have to see her and a whole lot of people i don't want to see for the rest of my life. including steven, the king. my ex best friend, and my ex boy friend. (again with the spelling, i do realize all that is one word, but i am hesitant to go back an change it because i am at 18 minutes and 7 seconds right now. i love this kind of writing, we should do it all the time, always. landon used to always say that. a good man, that landon phillips. too bad some girl named roxy had to go and taint such a good man. i had a lot of friends who were boys in high school, but not in college. maybe that is because i live in littlefield. ladybugs! oh man, i like to steal the doormat and put it in front of other peoples doors. ha jokes on you ",1
"i wonder what i am doing right now, this is a little annoying, stupid grammer mistakes are irritating me. hmmm, i hope that jennifer likes the present that i have for her. how am i going to get back, and how am i going to get back? how much will it cost, how will i do on my psychology test i have the coming monday. i hope that i will still have time to study. oh well, i'm tired i really wish i didn't have to do this right now. hehehe, i wonder if that guy i just e-mailed will reply to me anytime soon, and i wonder if he'll actually have what i want. how much will the new motherboard i need cost? can i wait 3 months? i hate waiting, oh well. i wonder if jennifer is asleep right now, i really do miss her. atleast i'll get to see her when i go back for her birthday next week. this is really going to take a long time to do, the writing assignment i'm doing right now. havnt' played pool in a while, i hope that i'm still decent. what's on the tv right now and why am i paying so much attention to the way that i'm typing right now, i keep going back and making corrections to my mistakes when it already said i shouldn't. bad habit i guess, always want everything to be perfect. dumb browser, messing up. annoying sound. i hope that when i go to block-buster tomorrow they will final fantasy viii. i wonder if it will be as good as it's supposed to be. i hope that i do good in college, get goood grades and do well in general, though i also hope that i have fun also. it's a bit anoyying having to think and type so fast at the same time oh well. i have to do it for my assignment. the tv is really loud and annoying right now, unfortunately my roommate is watching it right now and i'm doing thing right now so i can't stop and turn it down or anything. i like my roommate pretty much we get a long pretty well, but anyways why am i thinking of this, never knew that my mind switched from thoughts so suddenly. i wonder if i have attention defecit disorder. i hope now, that would be really bad, though that might explain why i never really did as well as my brother or sister in school. i wonder what they are doing now. i wonder if they've ever drunk alcohol. anyways, that's none of my bussiness. hmmmmm. i wish i didn't have to go to school tomorrow, wish i could just stay home and just rest and enjoy myself. i sill need to do my calculus, philosophy, and psychology. the other part of it atleast. it's a little difficult right now with all these distractions, but i guess i'll cope. hmm. don't really know what to think about or write about right now. hmm i wonder how much my plane ticket will cost when i buy it, i hope it doesn't cost too much. but it's for her, so i guess it's worth it. wish i could see her right now. i rememver the first time i saw her, it was a little strange and i didn't know her name. hehehe. she was cute, nice to look at and she was nice  too. anyways i'd better stop thinking about her and get my mind on some work. another thing i wonder how i'm going to pay for my plane ticket i still havn't recieved my bank card or checking card from bank of america. annoying. hmmm. those funyons look good right now, i wonder if i should stop right now and eat some food. i wonder if the milk is still good, or if it's bad now. i'm in the mood for some cereal right now, kinda wierd. but i've always been a little wierd. anyways this is getting rediculous and a bit tedious also on my fingers. getting tired from just looking at the screen right now and typing. oh well. how much longer is it, oh  5 minutes. i guess that's not too bad. hmmm. i want to stop. anoyying. oh well. aonly a little longer. i'm starting to get careless. but anyways. i wish kevin would stop messaging me right now i'm trying to do this but i can't with him messageing me. tv is getting louder right now, must be some horror movie or something. too bad i can't turn around to look right now and type the same cause it would be a little difficult to do so right now while typing and having to occasionally look at the keyboard to make sure i don't mess up. i wonder if my fingers look wierd right now moving in this order. oh well, who cares. only 2 more minutes till i can stop and maybe either rest and sleep or eat some more food. now what will i eat, cereal, hamburger??? who knows. i wonder how much i've typed already. hopefully i typed a lot cause it would be cool if i would type really fast. one more minute right now. why do i always put more periods than i need to???? i always do that with just about everything. but again who cares. finally time is up!!!!!!!!

"geez, i'm trying to think about what i'm supposed to write about for 20 minutes. this is weird. i wonder if people use this assignment as a dear diary"""" thing. i wonder if the psych people are going to read every single one of these writing assignments. that would be a lot of reading to do. how can they read so much? i get so tired of reading all the time. i want to have fun. instead of having fun though, i'm always stuck in my room reading all the time. i hate reading. school reading isn't fun. text book reading that is. i don't like reading textbooks on weird classes to read on like chemistry. why do we need a next book for that class besides for doing homework problems. no one reads the text book crap. i don't even understand why some classes have certain books. hm. i just don't like reading. i think this means that i'm going to have problems in college later on. everyone always tells me that when you're in college, you have to have the patience to read everything. if what i read what actually interesting, i wouldn't have a problem. hmm, well i remember in english in high school, a lot of the books that we read were really interesting. i liked lord of the flies and anthem, and the scarlett letter. those were really cool books. the bad thing about the readings was that we had to analyze every single thing! i hated analyzing. i mean, analyzing is important, but not when you have to analyze stupid stuff. i remember on the scarlett letter test we had to analyze why the grass was green. what the hell was that all about? i don't' get it! there are some things that don't really need explaining. they're just fact. how can you explain fact? seriously, i think teachers just want to see how well we can think of things at the top of our head. i think they're trying to teach us something on that. how well you can come up with some explanation in a split second. actually, i guess that can come in handy. like for example it can help you with coming up with an excuse to your boss on why you were late. you wouldn't get a """"good grade"""" if your reasoning wasn't valid enough. hmm. i don't know. some teachers are cool. i miss my teachers back at home. i miss mr. fred, he was such an awesome teacher. i somewhat liked calculus because of him. he had a weird personality. that's what made him cool. i also miss mrs. conrey. she was fun to talk to too. i miss our little group in bio2. that was my favorite class! i loved hanging out with the gang. geez, i can't believe that time is gone. life went by so fast. i wish i could go back and relive some moments. not to change them. but to feel that kind of happiness again. now, everyone is so concerned with getting to know new people. i mean, i don't mind getting to know new people but not everyone likes the whole """"hi, my name's rebekah, what's yours?"""". i think certain people would get really annoyed by that. geez, there are so many people in this school, it's not even funny. i miss knowing everyone you pass by. it's kinda like that cheers song. """"where everybody knows your name. dum da da dum. and they're always glad you came. dum da da dum. """" i love that show. hehe, it's great. geez, life passes by way too quickly. it's kinda funny to think about how that was the """"seinfeld"""" or """"friends"""" during that decade. hehe, but it's still funny. it's funny how people don't like watching those old shows anymore. i don't care how old they are. if they're funny, they're funny. that's all that matters. it gets annoying how everyone puts up with the same friends reruns. it's so annoying. but still a great show. i remember when a new season would start, everyone would say """"ohh, this is the last season!"""". the last season is finally here. i mean the show is still really funny and all. but come on. everyone knows that it was getting really old. everyone's hooking up with someone else. it's kinda annoying but kinda cute how that worked out. but i think it's wrong how joey hooks up with rachel. i'm sorry but ross and rachel belong to only each other. it's wrong to see them not together. i really hate how they're not married on the show. dude, you shouldn't have a kid unless you're married. you're just asking for your kid to have problems if you're not. what the hell is this all about how girls have sex b'4 marriage. i think it's so stupid! what the hell happened to good morals and traditions? now everyone's a whore. that's so disgusting. how can you share yourself with everyone you see? grr, people annoy me.

"its really hard to write what i am thinking about because when i am asked to do that, i think about what to write. i then go and think of other things that are on my mind and really don't need to be shared with the general public. what i am physically feeling right now is heat. our house is hot although we have the a'c running non stop. mentally, i am confused. the thoughts that go through my head at times make me think that i am crazy and that i should seek help. i am not the only one who thinks that but my family members and my friends also think that i should get some help. but truthfully, there is no help. who controls the mind?  ones self controls the mind. all i really have to do is concentrate and i can control myself. powerful things can be accomplished with mind control. its odd how sometimes i know what people are going to ask me before they ask me. it happens allot. then people look at me in an akward form. i don't know how that happens. it just does. i can also go through the thought process of other people. sometimes, when my friends perform certain actions, i can think the exact same thing they were thinking at the time they were doing that. the only time this thought process causes a problem is when i am reading the news and read about acts of violence against children. its not that great when you can place yourself in the shoes of the aggressor when you really don't want to. its all invouluntary. this would be allot easier if i was writing in pencil. i think faster when i am writing things down. it helps me organize my thoughts. when i speak to people, i like to confuse them. sometimes i confuse them so much, they believe that a conclusion was reached at the end of our conversation but when they think about it, they find out that i only caused them to think of more questions. i don't know why i enjoy that. when we think, what do we think about the most?  what is easier or what needs a solution. writing about what i think is hard. i am not sure if i think of too many things at once or just don't think at all. i do just stop thinking and drift off into my own world and just stay there, thoughtless?  feelings:  mixed feelings. not sure what to do with my life. would prefer not to be in college but know that sucess comes with knowledge. psychology has interested me since i was a child. i like knowing what people are thinking about. that is what i do; i observe. but observation comes with a price. since i play the role of observer, it is hard for me to actually detail what is going on in my day and not others. people think that i really don't want to talk much about myself (which is true to some extent). what really happens is that i don't know how to organize my daily activities to be shared with others. silence is my audience when i am by myself. but when i need to concentrate and do my homework, i need noise. i can not concentrate where it is quiet. the silence distracts me. when i read, i listen to music. when i do other homework that does not involve reading, i listen to music, talk to others, and also do the homework of another class at the same time. i need distractions to concentrate. another physical pain came to my mind. i have back pain. most times, i take pain killers to ease the pain. the pain killers i use arent that effective and they are stong pain killers. i take hydrocodone and naproxen 500 mg each. i sometimes take two naproxen and one hydrocodone or vice versa. that does very little to ease the pain. since they are so effective, i just don't take them and deal with the pain. thanks to my servere back pain, i am now not affected by other types of pain. i need a new body. i also have knee pains. i have joint pain. i am overweight. i need to do something with my life. something new. i would like to skydive. life is not worht living if you don't take risks. i ran out of things to write about. i lost my stream of consciousness. i need the weekend to be here so that i can catch up on my homework. i procrastinate too much. i have talked to a psychiatrist before. it really didnt help. nothing helps. once must deal with their problems themself and keep them to themself. contorl them with ones mind and keep them undercontrol.

"not as much concentration, nor as deep a thought. i have always had a problem with being too easily distracted - like now i just lost my train of thought. i try to think about too many things at once and i do not really have a choice about what i think. when i was doin the pretesting i often found that if any question required any thought or recoolection at all i was drawn a blank at it. i simply could not look deeply into what i saw. i have related this problem to many possible sources - this is why i decided that i did not want to smoke marijuana. it is also why i am thinking that i should not smoke. it is possible that smoking could have a depressive effect on the mind. maybe i do not drink enough water, or sleep too little or too much. there really is no way to know for certain. i should probably just lead the best life that i know how instead of the easiest, which is what i do. i know there are things i need to get done, things that i do which are just wasting my time, and things that i know are just plain wrong but i always reason my way around these issues. or rather i just stop myself from thinking about them. it really cannot be good to be like this - i am feeling like i inhaled a little too much glue - actually i am probably just using the computer too much. by continuously focusing on an external source of entertainment right in front of me i feel that i am rotting my brain. this assignment is not helping either because i am not allowed to stop and think about things - once again i am simply functioning on the basest level possible. i like the movie the stand a lot, and i have read the entire book once and the first half two more times. i never really can finish it, but this last time that was because i decided that reading was bad for me. in all honesty, it is probably better for me thatn enything else i do because it might encourage deep thought. i should probably also listen to music without words - one is forced to think deeply with that because there is nothing else really for your mind to do. i listen to the play les miserables all the time now - and it is interesting because it is a very sad play - in a way it makes me sadder than anything. i feel like i would cry if i would ever cry, but i never do. i cry maybe once every year or two, and it is usually for something silly. the last time i cried sincerely was when highschool ended i had just listened to i will remember you, the sound they played at graduation. i also saw grease and st. elmo's fire, both of which remind me of high school. soon after i cried quite a bit over the loss of something which i didn't really care about in the first place. i think it is because i have never liked the end of anything, and the end of highschool is much like the end of the first section of you life. although there is a marginal change from elementary to junior high, and junior high to high school, they are still organized schools in the public school system, often ever within the same school district. every day at 7 am you get up to prepare for school which you are required to go to at 8. there are tardies and classes and a bell and teachers that know your name. lunch is in a cafeteria at a specific time and there is a meal of the day that you must pay your 1. 50 or 1. 75 for. it is really all the same thing, just twelve different grades in the same school. college is more like a job than like the old school system - it is a huge change. i simply hope that my friends don't go crazy and decide to move off or something after college. this would be the death of me because i will not, can not, and don't want to make new friends. however, i have found that no contact with friends slowly drives me mad. i would love for me jere and nolan and robert to stay local forever. i would like them all to, but i do not see how i could live without at least (robert and nolan), (jeremy and robert), (mark and robert), (robert and ben), (jeremy and ben), (jeremy and mark). therse combinations would be able to keep me satisfied for just about forever. of course, you know the freakin psychos will all go off and get married like the sick bastards that they are. they should read a little bit of saint paul, the fools. he knew the wisdom about not getting married. that was one of the things that pissed me off about your pretest. it asked is my shyness  interfered with my dating or something like that. no, my shyness doesn't interfere with my freaking dating, cause i don't date!  i never will date, i barely ever have dated, and i think that people who do date should be lined up and flogged until they come to their senses. in my junior year people always used to say, well craig, you are just bitter cause you can't get any. well, at the time that was partially true, but since then i have had opportunity galore. in my senior year, jana (the cheer leader), heather, myriah, jill, and melissa all openly admitted that they liked me. did i pursue?  did i?  well, i admit i foolishly wen out with jana (worst mistake of my life, btw). but no one can say that i can't get any. no sir. there was a girl on my floor last year that may have liked me (the only girl i have bothered to meet in all of college so far). peopl also say well just wait until you meet the right person craig - then you will change your mind. well who are they kidding?  i already said that i had no interest in meeting any people at all. i have met basically zero peopl since i have been in college. i met my roommate, and i briefly spoke to nero and christina (i think that was her name) but that is it. i have met no one in my classes nor do i have any remote interest in meeting them. once last year a girl called me up to ask me to study with her (highly possible that she was interested in me as well) but i had no interest in doing so. i sat there in terror hoping that she wouldn't ask me to study with her, for i would have to turn her down which i hate to do. that will probably how i will end up getting hitched. i just won't be able to say no. i am terrible at that.

"if i were to fly to pennsylvania to see julia, brint and i would have to go together, it'd cost a hell of a lot but maybe for spring break or something we could go. she says it's really pretty up there, it gets really cold too. i hate the cold weather. i have an image in my head of these nice clean streets, kind of hilly, in autumn with all the leaves changing colors and falling on the ground. she says it's supposed to be beautiful, like a carpet. and we'd go see vicky in philly. though we'd have to take the train, all sorts of new stuff. but i won't get to see her until christmas and i know i won't be able to go before that. she's going to disney world before christmas so i won't even get to see her much then either. i've never been to disney world or disneyland or anything. all i want is some of those mickey mouse ears and to ride the teacup ride. i told cassandra in eighth grade or our freshman year or something that when she went to get me some and i'd pay her back but she never got them. i wish we still would have been friends just a little more in high school. i mean i realize that the whole little group broke up when we got to high school but still. i really wish i was still good friends with andrea. i miss her so much sometimes. she's dating some guy now that i don't even know, i didn't even know she was dating someone. we used to be such good friends, inseparable. i practically lived at her house an entire summer and we did everything together. then i left her and she went off and became """"popular"""" or whatever. which pisses me off because i when we got to high school she was fat and not that pretty and now all of a sudden she's miss beauty queen and she's too good to hang out with me. not that we would have anything in common these days and i guess it is my own fault for the way things went. but i just wish i would have gotten to share some of those high school things with her. i miss her so much. it's really weird because i have all these best friends, like 5 or 8 and its not like i ever thought about her much in high school. every once in a while, but now that i'm here it seems that i miss her more, i haven't really thought about her any more than normal i guess. although right before i left, for a couple of days i thought about her a lot and i really wanted to email her a letter of some sort, kind of apologizing i guess for the way things went between us. they didn't go bad or anything, they just kind of went away. i think i still might email her. the reason behind it all is jeremy. i talked to him the other day and it was weird. like it didn't feel weird at the time but now that i look back and think it was just weird. i 'd really like to see him again sometime soon. i don't know why because i know it probably won't be good for me. things are strange because if i'm not around him for a while i'll think about him and in an odd way miss him. but the second i get around him i suddenly realize why the hell i hate him so much and why i can't stand to be around him. i'm sure i have some underlying issues with all that that i just can't define or pick out. well i know i do, i dated the damn guy for three years of my life. three years of high school no less. my first real experiences are all owed to him. now that i look at it, it was probably a really bad idea, in know it was, to date him all while i'm just being introduced to things in the world. those are things i should have experienced on my own, not with him in my life. and plus i wasted 3 years of my life, there's no telling who or what would have happened in those three years. or who i would have become. which is the other aspect of it, i'm not sure which side i agree with more. because if it weren't for him i wouldn't be who i am today and i think for the most part i like who i am. and i had all these experiences with him and i learned so much and it just makes you wonder what would have happened and how would i have turned out if i hadn't dated him. i mean i'm glad i have all these experiences under my belt because i sure as hell wouldn't have wanted to come here without knowing a lot of the things i do, and i'm glad they were with somebody i """"loved"""". but it just really gets to me to think, what if. i'm so curious to know how things would have gone if it weren't for him. and now i'm even starting to doubt my love for him. was i really in love or was i just fooled somehow? i'm sure i loved him as a person, and now i'm even starting to wonder about that too. maybe it's just the suppressed anger or whatever that makes me doubt my feelings for him, or maybe i just honestly didn't. but i was obviously feeling something at the time. and last time is so much different than this time. that's what brought on the whole questioning thing of do i really know what it is to be in love or am i just imagining these things?

"about two weeks before i came to austin i was already feeling the affect of college changing my life. many of my friends left before i did and i said goodbye to all of them. i knew that it would be awhile before i saw any of them again. it feels really strange now that all the people that i have grown up with all my life are all going to new places. many of the people from my high school i may never see again. even though my high school was very large the faces i saw were familiar to me. now that i am at the university of texas many faces i have never come across before and that is a strange feeling. i kind of like having so many different people around. it just makes me feel better to know that i'm involved in such a large university. everyone that i do meet is very nice and i am making many new friends. my roommate and i are getting along very well and i am glad that i have him as a roommate. i have seen many people from my high school, but many of the upperclassmen i knew from my school live off campus so i might only run into them every once in awhile. it is strange that i don't have a """"bestfriend"""" anymore because all of them are some other place. the people i hang with aren't as close to me as my old friends were. i guess that it has only been a couple of weeks so far and that is just how it will be until i live around here longer. i don't really wish that i had gone somewhere else, but i just get that home sick feeling a little. home sick doesn't mean that i miss my parents so much, but just that all the people i was familiar with are gone. i don't really miss my parents that much yet, but i'm sure that i will soon when i finally realize that i'm not living there anymore and the ut is my home now. i wish that i had a car so that i could go places around here. i'm stuck on campus pretty much all the time. almost everything that i need is here though so that is a good thing. i wish that i could have brought my turntables up to ut, but my parents didn't want me to yet. i hope that i can dj at some clubs when i get a little more experience. my older friend was kind of my mentor to becoming a dj and i'm hoping that he can give me the hook ups that i need to play at places. i don't like being alone in my room especially with the door shut it makes me feel closed off. if i'm here alone i will usually keep the door open so i can converse with the people outside. they have really good study rooms in the basement of my dorm and its really good to go down there and read or do homework. college so far has been pretty much what i expected it to be there hasn't been any real shockers yet. i only choose to come to ut my senior year. my parents both went to arkansas so i didn't really have a bias to any college. i visited a&m and ut as well as ou and some other colleges last year and that is when i made my decision to come here. i like the urban atmosphere that ut has as opposed to all the other colleges i visited. since the time is up i better go down to the basement to study or else i won't make it into the computer science major.

"i sit staring at the blue syllabus from the class in front of me. what do  i write about? the sad part is that it seems like such a miniscule task. write about what i'm thinking about. so now i ponder what i normally think about? what do i normally think about, but i'm supposed to be writing about what i'm thinking about right now. i'm thinking i should turn of the television behind me, yet i'm so attracted to this rerun that i have watched so many times. although since i am writing this, i am not exactly paying attention to what is going on on the television. i can hear the faint noice in the background. why can't i concentrate? i always have this problem. i feel that my attention span has shortened as i have gotten older. i have problems watching a thirty minute television program! how can i sit here for twenty minutes on task? especially since i have a million things to do. such as a paper in my literature and the law class. but i am not able to sit for a long time and simply work on that paper. how did i ever get into college? sure my grades were somewhat decent, yet i always tend to work to the point of exhaustion, mainly because i procrastinate. when i procastinate i do all at once. since my attention span is so short, and i am not able to sit and continuously put forth a vast amount of effort my work comes out poorly. this must be why i have only decent grades. i must put forth more of an effort. life can be extremely challenging especially since i am not able to do such a miniscule task of prioritizing. but why am i complaining about my grades? college has just begun! i can turn around and begin new! but i say this every time and it never happens. sure you can change anything, but come on, am i actually gonig to do that? no! i'm just pathetic in that way. its like all the people i know who have broken promises. sure everyone says they'll do this or that,but do they? i am always upset when people break promises because i never break promises to other people except to myself! i can stop being a procastinator, but do i? i can start exercising more, but do i? the most important person in my life,me , is the one person who i put last. who cares how i look to others as long as i feel good inside. do i feel good inside? hard question. do i have an answer? i don't know. i'm constantly criticizing myself. come on sonia, you can be better at this or that. but do i make a point of actually becoming better no! i suppose all people are like this, they attempt to be someone their not. i have to just face the fact that i am who i am and if i really want to change i have the chance but i don't have to change!

"i really need to study for chemistry, but i just remembered that this assignment was due. i  would have done it earlier, but my computer has been giving me so many problems. first  all these warnings about """"you have spyware and adware"""" started coming up and then it started  working really slow--it took 15 minutes to open up the internet!!  then after a while it wouldn't  even do that--it just sat there!  so i tried to shut it down and it still didn't do anything--but if i  tried to start a program, it said """"this program cannot open because the system is shutting  down. """"  so i unplugged it and let the battery run out. computers are so stupid. but i guess we  couldn't live without them. i really hope i don't fail this chemistry test tomorrow. i'm really  nervous because it's my first real college test and it's also over some stuff that i don't  completely understand. my roommate is in the same class as me, but she's at the pcl--she  calls it her home because she's there every minute of every day--i don't know how she does it!!  studying for 10 minutes makes me feel like i need a break--she stays there for hours!!  she's  really sweet though. i so happy i got good roommates (yes--that's plural--i have 3  roommates--i'm in supplemental housing--it's not as bad as i thought it would be)  2 of my  roommates are really nice. the other one is kind of weird, but she's hardly ever here--she's  always at her boyfriend's house. that's kind of rude to her parents though--i mean--they're  paying for her food and housing and she's not even sleeping here. the only thing i know about  her is her name really. that's okay though--at least she's not using my computer all the time  anymore. when we first moved in she didn't have a ethernet cord so i said she could do her  add'drops on my pc. but then she printed off all her lecture notes for her classes (on my  printer--with my ink) so at least that's not happening any more. andy roddick lost in the quarterfinals of the us open tonight. that made me so sad--i love  andy roddick--he has to be the sexiest guy ever!  i met him last year and the tennis masters  series in houston and he signed my shirt--me and 3 of my friends had made shirts that spelled  out andy--he and his coach really liked them!!  but i really wanted him to win--he won the  open last year and that was his first so i really wanted him to defend it. oh well. the guy he  lost to was playing really good. he played the same type of game as andy though. they were  calling him a swedish andy roddick, but he'll never be andy roddick--he wasn't cute enough. chemistry and biology are going to kick my butt this semester. i'm not really sure if i want to  major in biology any more. i think it might just be too much science for me. i thought i could  handle it, but i just don't know anymore. i know majoring in biology will probably help me  make a good score on the mcat, though. i really want to get into med school. i want to be a  pediatrician. it's just so much school though. oy!  but i think it'll pay off. i really want to do  something with kids and i could do that and make money at the same time. i mean--it's that or  teaching right?  and teaching is definitely not on my list of things i want to do. my mom is a  teacher and they don't get paid half of what they deserve!  she works all the time--sometimes  she doesn't come home until after midnight--and she only works with 5th and 6th graders. i  mean--it's probably worse with older kids right?  i don't know--i just couldn't handle it--i'd  feel like i deserved more. chemistry time.

"i used to day dream about  this time when i was younger. after i saw my brother and sister leave for college, i decided that was going to be the best part of my life. of course, it is a lot different now that i am here. there is a lot more responsibility in reality than there is in my dreams. i don't really mind it so far. i want to be able to handle it, and i am excited about my classes. i wish that i could be an expert in every subject that i take. psychology is very interesting to me, but not enough to be my major--i wouldn't want to do it for the rest of my life. my brother has a bachelors degree in psychology from southwest texas, but he hasn't done much with it. i am taking this class as a social science elective; my other classes are required for my major. right now i am an undeclared major, but after a few classes in my geology of engineering course, i am pretty sure that i want to major in geosystems engineering. it seems to incorporate a large amount of subject material that i am interested in, and it would be a job that pays pretty well. if i did well enough at ut to get into grad school, i would love to follow it up with a masters or phd in geology. of all the courses i have taken in high school and college, these seem to be the best ones. some of my favorite subjects are: geology, geography, astronomy, archaeology, and history. i would love to be an astronomer in a second if it paid well enough. my reason for this is that eventually i would like to have a large spread of land in the hill country somewhere west of austin--near a lake--with a boat. this requires $$. i love the outdoors, and i want to live away from the city, yet close enough to it that i could drive into town to do things. this is probably a common ambition among people, but i don't really care. enough rambling about all that. my reason for being here at ut is to learn, and to get an education, and to do well. if i do all of this i will be very pleased. it will be hard though. i love to have fun, and that can easily get in the way at ut. i haven't joined a fraternity or gone out for rush yet, even though some of my friends who are in frats here keep bugging me. i want to join some organization that has fun and kicks ass at a lot of things. hopefully that will work out. these are the things that are on my mind at the moment; at least until i move on to the next thing.

"i'm really hungry. i'll have to go shopping after this. i don't know what to write. i really need to catch up on my reading today. i don't know why i always leave things to the last minute. i was going to try to keep up with things this year but i'm not doing a real goodd job. i have to do computer science tommorrow. that will be easy. i should have called darcie and megan this weekend and hung out with them. kyle should have come up too. i'm surprised i got mike to come hang out last night since he almost never leaves his apartment. i really want to go smoke but i probably shouldn't. i need to cut down. i wish i could think of a place to put these stickers. i had to kill a spider but i missed him. what weas up with all those spider questions in the pretesting. pretesting took a long time. and it seemed like a lot of pointless questions. i need to go sign up for experiments. there sure are a lot of beer cans lying around. i need to get everything cleaned up in here. i haven't finished unpacking yet. i have to go look for a job tommorrow. i wish i didn't have to work, but it will be good for me. i won't waste so much time hopefully. damn, i haven't been writing very long. i hate doing these things cause if i'm thinking about writing everything i think, then i don't think normally. i wrote think too much. there's so much shit i have to do. and i don't want to do it. i'll probably end up not doing any homework again today just cause i don't have to have it done yet. i can't wait to get out of school. i wonder if anyone will actually read this. if so, what's up. i'm getting tired of writing. i'm so hungry. i should start clipping coupons to take with me. i guess it'll make a big difference and i don't have a lot of money. i wonder what my sister's doing.  i should start taking some more pictures. i haven't really done any of that for a while. i wonder what's on that roll of film in my camera. it's been in there so long i don't know what i took pictures of. okay about five more minutes. shit. i wonder where i should try to get a job. hopefully something fun but i don't know what. i feel like i should have more written down for twenty minutes. oh well at least i did something. i don't want to write anymore.

"let's see. i'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone. this is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back. not that she's not a cool person or anything, i just can concentrate better when i'm alone and when it is quiet. but that is almost impossibe here in jester. there are always people roaming the halls making loud noises. like right now!  oh well, it is something i must get used to. or i can do what i did last night. wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done. i stayed there until 1:30 a. m. i guess i can do my work better at night. my fingers are freezing!  this room is so cold!  i haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane. i'm cold even when i go to bed at night with my blanket. i have to constantly keep a sweater on and i cannot wear shorts like i used to back at home. aw, home!  i think i am starting to miss being at home. i called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me. this, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs. i do go back home on thursday night, but only so that i can get to the dfw airport friday morning for my flight to atlanta. i am competing in a sports tournament for my church. i am playing flag football and running track. another cool thing about this weekend get away is that i get to see the guy i've been dating for less than a month. well, i've known him for about 4 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together. it's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. i went to a dance with him after that, but only because i didn't want to be mean. he is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me. that was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, i really don't care anymore. he is the sweetest and funniest guy i have ever met. i actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago. me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend. a week after we broke things off, this new guy i'm dating told me he had feelings for me. i was so confused and didn't know what to do because i had just got out of a relationship and i was going to be moving to austin in a few weeks. but i'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself. because of that, i decided that i'd go ahead and be true to my feelings and attempt to actully be with another guy. we decided we'd just go with the flow and not really label ourselves. my ex found out and was extremely jealous. it just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy. but oh well, that's life i guess. i am really glad i continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say. i spent every day with him until the day i left. i have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much. he is amazing. the only thing i'm worried about is that i'll fall too hard and too quickly for him. i mean i did just get out of a serious relationship and i don't think i'm quite ready for another one. that's the only problem i'm having right now. the fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to. but the distance might become an issue. it was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so i do feel a tad bit guilty that i'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex. but my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me. but yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at ut. but i am definitely loving it here in austin. i enjoy all of my professors and classes. having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough. in addition i am taking this psychology class, which i dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting. other than that i have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations. i just finished the reading for that class right before i started this assignment. ah, my hands are still so cold. what do i do?!  my ears are feeling very cold too. must i wear gloves in the summer in my dorm room?!  or my bad, it is the fall now. same thing. today is the day for my mile run. ever since i moved to austin, i have been running a mile every other day at the gregory gym. i absolutely love that place!  and it is so convenient because it is right next to jester. freshman 15 can kiss my booty because i am staying in shape!  i find that i've been working out more here than i was doing at home in the summer. i really love this lifestyle i have at ut. the whole freedom thing is still a bit overwhelming, but i do not feel like i am abusing it. i did party a lot this weekend, but i didn't drink or anything. people keep calling me a party girl and it is actually making me a bit upset. i don't want people to view me as a party girl because i'm not out of control or anything. oh well. i see that this writing is almost up. that wasn't too bad!

""""  that kind of funny because that for sure seems like the most important thing we have to do tonight. i love college. dave is now playing granny on the listener supported dvd and its kickin. i love this song. dave and his boys rock it out in concert if you have never been. . ggggggggggoooooooooo. ut is turning out to be pretty sweet. i love the wide variety of people you get to see on a daily basis. my last school had 1200 students so i knew just about everyone i saw, its a little different here, but its all good. just looked at the timer and it looks like i got about 3 minutes left. is anyone elses computer typing on like a 2 second delay?  anyway its been fun writing in a constant stream of continual conscience or whatever its called. phsycology is very interesting i really liked the lie detector test. props to michael for tricking that thing the second time around. just looked at the kitchen, it looks pretty clean who would have thought?  one minute left that's really all i'm thinking about right now. the class dj is good with the tunes they seem to be a sweet mix. talk to you later peace out whoever is reading this. bye.

"i have no idea what to type. am i supposed be be capitalizing and what not?  oh well. hmm its mike's birthday today. he is 22, that must be nice. wow, this is a great song straylight run - the tension and the terror. it's freezing in here. i need to finish reading government and psychology, and hopefully on the road too. it's a lot easier reading that though. yoga's at 8:30. am i supposed to meet melissa there or is she coming back to the room?  o well. i miss mikey =(  man, as i'm whining as if this is a diary entry. man, i forgot to call alex again. i guess i'll do it later. hmm, i wonder how tough rowing tryouts really are. o well. man, all i'm saying is o well. still not really sure what i'm supposed to be writing. now i'm listening to the juliana theory. good stuff. i'm not all about the class dj's choice of rap stuff. i don't think he is right about it making people more energetic. hearing a song for the millionth time that wasn't good the first time does not exactly put me in a great mood for an hour and a half psych lecture. but i do think i'm going to like the class (as i'm kissing up to the computer). no, its interesting stuff though. hmm, i'm still not sure about how government is going to be. i want to do law, and i think it's really interesting, but there's no way i'll have time for all the reading. and a lot of it is way too boring. hopefully if i take notes in class and what not i'll be ok. i hope calc won't be too hard this semester. a lot of it should still be review from high school, but i bet the end will be new hard stuff. too bad mikes not still around. the engineering majors are too damn smart. am i supposed to censor stream of conscious writing? because i figure that goes against the point, so i shouldn't go back and fix stuff, but this sure as heck isn't formal. o well. of course i am tempted to go back and count how many times i've said o well. ridiculous. hmm, i should really clean this room. but i guess most of the mess on my side is amber's junk. o, i guess no psych tomorrow. more time to nap in the afternoon, which is good because i know i'll be up way too late if i'm going to get close to finishing the reading for government. how late is gregory open?  i think 1 but is that every day?  i guess megan will know. we can always run outside too. the heat sucks, but i guess we should get used to it if we're going to have to do tryouts in the afternoon. texas is too damn hot. i miss wisconsin. we got to road trip over xmas. i don't know what to tell the parents though. hmm i'll have to plan. that way we can go by michigan like we told mike we would. hmm i miss summer. i know fall won't compare. i'm so sick of stupid frat parties, etc. at least i have awesome roomies. well, looks like times almost up and i've spent 20 minutes whining and doing this assignment completely wrong. once more, oh well.

"     i am a little worried about this asignment because i don't type very fast, but i guess this is giving me good practice. i don't know if i should go run before dinner or take the excerisese class that is after dinner. i need to do something because i will get into the pattern of not working out,and then i will gain the freshman 15 like very one says you do. there is just so many other things that i need to be doing. but i know that i feel better if i work out. if i gain weight i will get depresed and i won't want to do anything. i can't believe jason is so wraped up in working out. i am supposed to be the one worried about my figure. ana has lost weigh too. how does she stay so motivated, and excited about runing. i would go take that class, but i have never done kick boxing, and i will problay look very stuiped. there are girls that just never shut up in this dorm. and some that always have the perfect hair and make up. that just seems so high school to me. i am excited about the chrisitan soriety. i hope i can find some girls that i like to hang around with. surley their will be a couple that i will enjoy being around. i hope i enjoy the pledge retreat on friday. i bet we will be up all night. that means that i will probably be sick again. ana is coming down on saterday, and i hope that amy will come to. amy has grown up so much in the last couple of months. i can't believe that she is being exposed to all of the jenkins trama with jims affairs. that is just a burden that she should not have to have. i know i think about it all the time and i did not have to listen to it as much as she did. it just amazes me how he could have done that. i wonder if he has some kind of mental problem. it would not surprise me, look at his dad. i just hope graham is not like his dad. surley ana would know if he was. at least i hope she would know, for her sake. i think it is funny how pam all the sudden likes to cook now. she is in her late fortys and is just now learning how to cook. thats sad. i am glad that i grew up in a family who cooks, and eats dinner together at night. or at least we did when we  were little. not all the time now that everyones off to college. it was so wird going home this weekend, it was almost like i had to get used to it again. it has felt so far away for the past three weeks. i don't want to go home too much. i want mom and dad to get the feeling that im gone, and so then when i come home it is special. jason made me mad this weedend, becuause he did not come and visit with my parents. i took time out of my schedule to come and visit his parents. his parents seemed weird this weekend also, i wonder what was up. page seemed like she was jelouse that they were having to buy jason some new cloths. that is so rediculous. she is a grown woman that can act like a small child some times. she can be very stingy. i can't believe that jasons parents don't support him very much, i guess i am just used to having the best dad in the world  ",0
"today i felt very happy. this morning at church i felt more comfortable becuase it was more traditional to me. i guess after my youth back at my hometown that's all i like. my stomach hurts a little right now, as much as i eat i don't know why i keep losing weight. last night was our date with martha and zra, it didn't go as planned, at least for me. i don't know what the deal is, but my luck with women is just not the best. man, those little granola bars are the best, the one i ate with my salad today. i'm thinking about talking to that girl in the cafeteria. she is 22 i think, but then again, age is only a number in college. in college it doesn't feel like i'm classified anymore, it's just that i'm an adult now. since i've been here, i miss my family, but i haven't gotten homesick. traffic here is horrible, it's to fast. i want to see that new movie freddy v. s. jason. i don't know why but i read that this girl wasn't into scary movies. it's dark outside, i think i'm going to go run after this. well the titans v. s. raiders game is on. i went to ernie's house yesterday to go watch all the football games that went on for college. hopefully i don't get challenged for beating robby and ernie at ncaa. that referee has an anoying voice. i ate a cookies and cream ice cream bar, it was pretty good. my roommate is laying down. i don't know why it seems he doesn't have as much school work as i do. i type pretty fast for a guy. i really need to get that program for my computer with power point and all. right now i'm looking at a picture of my family and pet's. i think i have to have the best parent's ever, i mean, if it weren't for them i wouldn't be here right now. i kind of want to here some ron isley. this guy said he french kiss a french woman. kinda funny. this weekend we went to spiro's, met up with stephen, couldn't get a wristband. my printer is so slow, it's loud also. my fingers are kind of cramping and i still have 10 minutes left. there is a little running icon on the left of my screen. the sky looks awesome right now, it's like the sun just passed the horizon. i got back in at 5 a. m. last night. i was pretty tired, i ate a pop tart before i went to bed. i don't know why, but i knew i shouldn't have ate but i was hungry. i always think to myself if you just sleep through it, you won't be hungry"""" i talked to brittany today, she is pretty hot. i think she has a boyfriend back in her hometown. speaking of which, why is everyone going back home? they just got here. i know if i went to tech i wouldn't be going home all the time. i keep hearing a little bit of words from the tv  and it said """" the crowd is loud """" and """"another flag down """" stickie note says, aug 29 fig meeting. our fig supervisor is pretty hot also. she is a sophomore, so maybe i could talk to her too. next week we play arkansas. i remember one time at tech during my athletic training for nca, i thought i was in a tornado. rosalinda was eating pizza that night. a bright neon light. i hope that this test doesn't say that i think about food to much, i've said something about food like 6 times. i used to be a big guy, 280 lbs. now i'm down to 210. i feel better, just not sculpted. i'm kinda nervous to go to greogory gym to go join a rec sport. i'm not sure how it works and i don't have the money to just throw up in the air. hey, i just looked away from the computer for once. right now as i type i'm looking at all the wires on the floor. that could start a fire. nah, the papers are not close enough. that didn't make sense. i have this candle from initiation the other night. i kept it because i like keeping sentimental. i also collect coca cola bottles. i gave up cokes like a year ago. i think this whole year i might of had 10 cokes all together. that's healthy. especially here, all you can do is sweat here, i hate it. the trash can is fully, i threw it yesterday but i forgot to put a bag in it. i hear someone passing outside. you know, sometimes i drift away from my mind set when i drive. it's like i don't remember how i was driving from point a to point b. it's kind of hard to explain. it usually happens when i have a millions things running through my head. internet globe. that recycling commercial keeps coming on that bad ass station. 93. 3. love. my mom loves me, she wants to send me money for my birthday next week. wow, the big 19. i'm getting old, only 2 more years and all will be good. something i've waited for in awhile. my grandparent's. god bless their souls. i miss them so much. love you grandma and grandpa!

"the following has been transcribed from paper exactly as it was written (including all mistakes, misspells, etc):   let's see. its really hard to do this assignment because i find i have trouble doing this assignment  i messed up there. it's hard to write down your own thoughts because i find that even as i am writing this i am already thinking something else. it's hard to get into the right mindset because as i'm writing this i feel like okay. i'm writing a paper for psychology, not i'm writing down my thoughts. what i was going to say above before i messed up was that i can't or rather, i'm having a hard time with this assignment because i can't, i mean i have trouble doing something on cue or when someone tells me to do something. it's difficult to do something that usually comes naturally when someone gives you certain perameters to do it in. its like someone telling you to go the bathroom when you don't have to. or its kind of like when some one tells you """"don't think of an elephant"""" what's the first thing you think of?  in this assignment, its like you're telling us, """"don't think of it as writing a paper for a psychology"""" or was that the whole point?--to see if we could write down our thoughts freely and as they come to us without--oh @#&*!  i lost my words or i don't know how to word what i was thinking rather. i find that this happens to me often. i really don't feel like i'm writing down my thoughts, i feel more like i writing an entry in a diary or journal. hmmm. i wonder when my friend christine is going to call, i hope soon because i need to get the store before it closes--todays sunday so everything closes early. i hate waiting for phone calls because i hate that feeling of not knowing when they are going to call. you expect the phone to ring any minute but at the same time not to. it just happed again--in the middle of the previous sentence i had to pause because i wasn't quite sure how to word myself. sometimes you have feelings that cannot be expressed in words (at least for someone like myself--i'm no shakespeare). i'm writing this down on paper & i'm  going to type it later. i've just had to switch to--oh never mind-that really wasn't what i was thinking. i really wish this stupid cold would go away. i keep sniffling every 5 seconds and coughing too. times almost up--1 more minute. i can't think now with that in mind. so i'll end here.

"well, i'm thinking right now about how thinking about what i'm going to write is going to effect what i'm going to write. i'm thinking that 20 minutes is a long time to write considering that i type at a fairly good clip. i'm thinking i won't start each sentence with i think. i've come up with the idea for the perfect television show. it'll be a cross between chips and pacific blue. it'll be about moped cops in missouri, it'll be called m. o. p. d. it'll star katie holmes and busta rhymes as the street savy ex con turned cop. no one on the force knows if he can be trusted, but he's found a friend in katie, or sam mcgillaway on the show. i've decided that i really like fencing, and that at least at this early state i have a better mastery of the sport than most people in my class. i'm really thinking that this is going to be hard to to for twenty minutes. i miss my girlfriend. my ear itches. my roomate displaces much ground when he walks, or at least it sounds as if he does. i guess that's me thinking about my sensory preception. i hear him playing quake in the background, or should i say, behind my head. i wonder if i'll get full credit for my diff eq assignment. do teenage cats drink hairspray so their hairballs will look good?  always wondered that. it's amazing how well i can get my ideas to flow from my brain to my hands. i'm sure it's a combination of my typing savvy and my slowing of the thought process so i can type everything i think. my roomate's whistling the daily show theme. i like john stewart movies. i like patrick stewart movies. i wonder how many degrees it would take to connect him to kevin bacon. i wonder how i come up with connections like this. my instant messanger sounds are starting to get on even my nerves. i wonder how i'll do this semester. i know the 5hrs of credit i got for spanish will help my gpa, but will they offset the potential disaster that is either diff eq and or computer science 310?  do i really want to be a computer science major?  i really like cooking. bam!. that's what emeril says. it's only been 5 minutes since i last looked at the clock, and that was maybe a total of 10 minutes ago. hmm. minutes and minutes were in the same position on those two lines. although they may not be when you read this. i wonder if my roomate's going to play the same song he always does. i miss home, mostly because of my girlfirend. i wonder if i'm supposed to put a comma in the name field. if obi wan kenobi has the ability to run with incredible speed, then why does he wait for the force field things to close and thus causing the death of his mentor. what's the deal with all the star wars major light sabre scenes (or most of them) ending with some guy falling down a large pit'shaft type thing?  is george lucas trying to tell us something?  i can hear real songs in my roomate's playing. neither of us have been playing that long. i just showered, but my nose already feels oily. i think my leg's asleep. there's two asses in assassination. i think my whole leg is asleep, or getting there fast. i'm not used to sitting normally in my chair, but i did it to facilitate my typing. i wonder if facil or something like that is a latin root. spanish for easy is facil. facilitate means to make easy. makes sense to me. sounds like my roomate's trying to learn the solo to breakfast at tiffanie's. it's not that hard. i wonder if i'm catching mostly audio cues because my eyes are focused on a particular task?  that's my guess. well, that looks like about 20 minutes ",0
"i still feel sleepy because i just got up a few minutes ago. i am wondering if that is a good way to start a stream of consciousness exercise. my computer told me that i misspelled consciousness, but i don't believe it. i have always been a good speller, for years and years and my computer is only a few months old, so what does it know. i lost my geography notes sometime yesterday, so i'm still mad about that since i only found out a little while ago. it makes it tough, especially since the professor said that the class would be split into two parts. the book would cover one set of information, and the lecture would cover another, and i just lost the last two lectures. oh well. i am thinking that i am thinking too much about what to write, trying not to forget that stream of consciousness is just that. the wp still thinks that i can't spell and i'm becoming irritated because i can't stop writing for twenty minutes to check what the mistake is. i thought someone was in my apartment, but it was just my upstairs neighbors, apparently. it's not any fun having five people and change living right on top of you. i wonder what kind of day it will turn out to be. hot, probably. i can't wait for the cool weather to come. this oppressive heat makes me not want to go do stuff outside, and i love to do stuff outside. well, that's not true. it doesn't really make me want to not go outside, it just isn't encouraging. i'm thinking that i've already written a lot for only about 9 minutes. makes you wonder. i am wishing that i had all the cable channels in my bedroom, since i paid for them. i need a better study ethic. i think that i've been putting in about half the studying that i need to, but i haven't even had any homework or anything to study yet in my math class, so i'm not sure whether i should worry yet. i'm going home this weekend to see my friends and my dad, and i've been thinking about that a lot lately. i feel pressure to stay in contact with people at other school, etc. maybe after a while, i won't feel that way anymore. i'm sure i won't, just look at my sister. and my brother, they just do their own thing, have their own small groups of friends. i feel i should include my brother. i worry sometimes how i come off, how other people see me. but other times, i couldn't care less how they see me. i think it's justified, i'm not a hypocrite, i just have an idea of myself and how i want to be and be seen and certain things dictate that i make an effort on them, and with other things, if i don't seem to care, then that is how i want to be seen. i realize that my writing is vague, only in ideas and few personal details, but that is what i'm comfortable with. i don't believe in diaries. if i ever did this sort of thing on a regular basis, then i wouldn't ever keep it for someone to find. i would destroy it. kind of a harsh phrase isn't it. """"destroy it. """" like it came from a movie or something. """"destroy it. """" i'm about to come to the end of my twenty minutes and i think that i've spent too much time correcting typos. not that i make a lot of typos, but when i do, i always go back and fix them before i go on with my writing. i'm feeling sleepy again and i think i'll go make some coffee.

"it seems like the same thought wanders in the back of my mind and i lack control over when that thought surfaces. i have other current obligations, e. g. find a job, do some reading out of my books, clean my room, do laundry, call my mom, find my friend, arrange for a ride home, i need money. i can list what i need to do but once i get around to it, that thought surfaces and it overrides my focus. i can't focus on doing anything else, except think about that one thing. well, that one thing is my boyfriend back home, and funny as it may seem, i think he's the one i'm going to marry. this relationship is just too good to ignore, so i wonder about him a lot. we have never had a real fight where we accuse one another of doing something wrong. i've been procrastinating a whole lot more since he has been a part of my life, mainly because that's the way his mind functions and i noticeably have a tendency to imitate my friend's personalities and mannerisms. i still have a better work ethic than he does. but he gets very distracted while doing work that he's not quite so interested in. i suppose also, i'm always waiting on him to send me a message, email, or give me a call. i am a rather independent person. i don't like to hang out with the same people a lot, and i don't like to do group work, study with other people, walk to class with other people, but i rather spend a day locked in a 4 x 4 ft box with him than be away from him for a week. now that is what i call companionship. i haven't had a best friend like him since i was 7. i don't think i would be thinking about him so much if he didn't' live 4 hours away. another thing that concerns me is the way i have organized my higher education. i haven't really picked out a major, i'm not even on a reasonable track. i'm take multiple social sciences classes just because that is what i like to read about but i don't ever plan to have a career in social sciences. i like math too, and i want to take more calculus, and maybe computer science classes, even though i don't plan on majoring in any of those. my major is communications, which requires me to take a lot of writing and english classes, and i absolutely hate english. i wanted to go to ut because i wanted to learn more. i like some of school in that i like to be more aware, conscious and be exposed to new ideas that i would have never thought existed. but the way ut works is you're suppose to be on a track based upon the degree requirements. we are learning in order to work. why can't we learn just to learn. maybe i will be a social science major.

"assignment 1 it is 12:00 am and my mind is very tired. it has been a very long and exhausting day, and i can't believe this is only the second day of class, i have a long way to go, hopefully ill be able to handle it. it seems as if i don't feel like thinking, my mind feels lazy as if it has been asleep this whole summer--i need to wake it up and make it start thinking again--like i did back in highschool. --or at least back before my senior year when i didn't really do much thinking at all. i hope tomorrow goes good and i am able to get all the stuff i need to get done. i'm kind of worried that i am not going to be able to manage my time while i'm here--like sitting here right now at midnight where no one knows where i am, kind of scares me. i have the freedom to do what i want now, and i hope i can still make myself do all the things i need to. i am also worried right now--walking back late at night by myself. it scares me to think of what might happen to me. but some things have to get done, and you just have to do them. i really would like to go to sleep right now, i think my tiredness is interferring with my ability to think about this writing assignment. maybe i should have waited until i was a little bit more awake. or maybe, i think better when i am tired. i don't know. my mind is blank right now, and i am feeling a little anxious that i am not writing what i need to be writing about,and that some how who ever is reading this will not give me credit because i didn't follow the assignment. i wish i could go home and sleep in my bed and my house, i am getting a little bit homesick. i already miss my family at home and all my friends. it gets lonely up here, when you don't really know to many people, sometimes i feel like i don't belong here and that what i am majoring in is totally wrong for me. i feel like i won't be able to handle calculus and some of my hard classes. but, i know i have to. i don't really have a choice right now--i have to at least finish out this semester and see how things go. i hope my roomate isn't worried about me, she left here about and hour ago and i told her i would be there in a little while. oh well, she probably just fell asleep or something. i am feeling kind of anxious right now--i don't think i like being here by myself--i don't know what it is. i feel anxious a lot--i should stop worrying about things so much. well the 20 minutes is up. the end ",0
"my feet really hurt. i wish i would have made that dance team. if that stupid bitch lina had made it, i wouldn't feel so bad. i have always hated her. she is a stupid fat whore who i hope does not succeed in life and ends up as fat as her mother. having an abortion and then denying it, what a lying sack. i hate people like that. i want my computer to work all the time. i am so sick of it being messed up all the time. tracy dropped psychology. damn. i was hoping we could get to know each other by studying together and going to class together. that would be really nice. i need to meet more people here. i like hanging out with all my old friends, but i need to meet some more. those dance girls were all airheads though. maybe it is a good thing that i didn't make it. i would have to around all hose goof ball people all the time. that would kind of suck. man, i wish i could loose some weight. i am not going to if i keep eating all this shitty dorm food. with as much as i work out, i should be loosing weight. why not. mark wants to loose weight just as much as i do, but i guess it is just as hard for guys to loose weight as it is for girls. whatever. i am already tired of this assignment. i guess it is better that having some tight ass paper to write. my rhetoric response paper sucked. i hope i get a good grade on it though. i have to make good grades this year. i will die if i don't. i want to, and my parents will kill me if i don't. not enough time for sex though. i guess when you first start having sex you want to do it all the time. too bad mark doesn't want to. i wish he was just a little bit more of a horn ball. what a weird thing to say. i girl wanting a guy to be a little bit more horny. isn't it supposed to be the other way around? whatever. i really want to have sex now. look what i d id to myself. that girl on the south mall was really weird. there are no hot guys in any of my classes. well at least that i can see. i can't see anyone in my huge ass classes 200540 people. what bullshit! this is such a huge school. it's ridiculous. my hands hurt because i am typing so fast and so much. whatever. need to pop my knuckles. there. i can't believe that ken reynolds died that is crazy 42 years old. that really scares me. if matt calls in the middle of the night one more time, i think i am going to throw the computer at the wall. i love this song """"falling from grace"""" it is awesome. it makes me think of a movie. i'm not sure which one though. maybe some drug movie or something. all that reading i have to do. college is way harder than i am wanting right now. i need more time for friends, sex, fun all that stuff. i think tomorrow after mark comes over we will sleep for a while and then maybe we will mess around. i don't know. we always do if we are alone in bed for any period of time. i am so excited about the football game. i get to sit with who. let's see. lindsey, mark, and ian, is that it? i can't even remember. oh yeah wes did not have a sports package, and david did not give them his id. man my neck hurts. i need another massage. that felt so good. i can't believe that lindsey has natalie in her rhetoric class. i hope i get a good grade on my rhetoric response paper. i need to start off with good grades and then try to keep them up rather than start off with bad grades and then try to get them up. this is really not that bad of an assignment. i can handle it pretty well. i wonder who is on the phone. it must be ian. what a weird kid. he is cool though. i am glad to have him as a friend. i wish wes would be a little more open when i try to talk to him. he is nice and i think he likes me fine, but he just always acts strange around me like he is uncomfortable. except when we are drunk. then we are like old friends. who knows about that boy. he has a complex mind. it was nice of him to say that he would be my assistant editor any time. i'd be his for sure. he was drunk when he said that though. i hope he meant. most people say that you say the truth when you are drunk, but some people think that you make stuff up when you are drunk. i don't, but i know some people do. i just want to have some new friends. i think i am going to friends with tracy she is nice and every time i see her, we talk for a while. today, she said they were having a gijoe barbie party tomorrow night. all the girls come as barbie and all the guys come as gijoe. that sounds like fun. i kind of wish i was in a sorority, but i guess i will live. oh well. there's twenty minutes.

"this is my first actual assignment of college so far. i've gotten all the homework assignments and practice problems, but this is the first one that really counts. at least it is the first assignment that i know of that really counts. of course, i'm not exactly sure what the professor is looking for, but i'm doing my best. i'm just hoping i'll get a good grade for this. so far, i'm having a lot of fun here in the lovely university of texas at austin. it's a lot of work, but then again, i know it will pay off in the long run. and despite the small forest i've killed so far making flash cards for spanish and medical terminology, its actually kind of fun. i like being busy, and i like doing things that lead to something bigger. in this case, it will hopefully lead to medical school. but that's enough about school, after all, i only live on campus, i'm surrounded by it! i'm in a great mood today and i have no idea why. i'm really hyper, and i didn't really do anything that unusual. i didn't eat an entire bag of pixy stix or anything. i did go swimming today, not nearly as much as i used to, but apparently it was enough to actually get some endorphins (if that's right) pumping. now all i need to do is keep up that routine. i'm wide awake, and ready to go, even it is eight o'clock in the evening, and i have about a dozen other things i should really get around to doing. at least i'm organized though. i didn't really think that would pay off that much in school at least not right away, but it is. i can't wait until my birthday; i'll finally be eighteen! its kind of funny how much a birthday can mean. even though it's not that big of a deal, it's still exciting. although the only thing i can do is go to clubs and join the military, and neither of those are exactly my kind of thing. it'll be nice to have people stopping and being completely amazed that a seventeen year old is actually in college. will wonders never cease? oh well, its all fun and games and it means presents! shallow, but its nice to get things. especially when you're one of those people who usually manages to remember everyone's birthday, even if it is a few days or weeks late. what matters is that i remember! i just like doing things like that, it makes everyone feel special, as pathetic as that sounds. i feel like this is the most incoherent thing i've ever written. i'm just rambling all over the place, but i hope this is what the professor is looking for. if this is stream of consciousness, i'm amazed anyone can actually read this kind of thing. it would drive me crazy to have to read all this rambling. as completely crazy and illogical as what i have written is, its nice to just be able to switch subjects like mad. it's a nice change from the whole introduction, body, and conclusion type of paper. still, this style of writing is very refreshing and it's a lot more challenging than i thought. i've never really sat down and tried to follow my thoughts for twenty minutes. i guess i just don't have that much to think about, judging from what i have written. and it's sad because i've actually written a fair amount of absolutely nothing. who would have guessed i could spend twenty whole minutes just writing this kind of thing?

"i hate this type of assignment, the kind of work that tries to force a thought into one's head. thoughts should come naturally, and when the mind is prompted, then nothing comes to it. well, as long as i'm supposed to be thinking, let's think about why i'm doing this. it's to get a good grade. why do i do anything. i always seem to respond in a manner in which the answer seems acceptable to everyone else. maybe i'm doing this to please everyone else: my instructor, my parents, myself. so why do i do everything else that i do?  why do i devote so much time to working out and exercise?  is it because i want to fool myself into living longer?  is it to mold my body in such a way as to attract others and get their attentions. i always say that i just don't want to become weak, that when i find someone to protect, i want to be able to protect them. but if i am always desparately trying to find this person that would fill the current void in my life, why is it i push everyone away?  my friends, my peers, my elders?  i don't do what everyone says is """"fun. """"  i don't hang around others for long, i don't go to parties, and i rarely impart what i truly feel. it seems as if i've been hiding half my life, hiding from others and from myself. inside, i scream to myself, """"go out have fun meet new people you boring dolt!""""  and in my mind i'm always prepared to do so, but when the moment of truth comes about, i never act out my true intentions, either being intimidated or discouraged. i remember when i went to that ut freshman orientation. my friend said when you get to the dance, just go up to people, introduce yourself, and ask for a dance. and he's a loser. but it worked for him, so i tried it myself. the first time, rejected. the second time, rejected. the third time, rejected, and even i know that 3 strikes is out. i get so sick of hearing excuses like oh i'm too tired or i don't feel like it. yeah right. then why the hell are you here at the dance?  just give me a straight and vehement no and i'll be on my way, not even to think twice about the encounter. now on strike three, i had another reason for retiring that night. that girl, the way she looked, the way she acted, it was deja vu. i went to another country with a girl like that, stood by her side, opened my heart to her, and offered it to her. she led me on, to believe that for once, i had an opportunity for love, that it was my time in the spotlight, and with the most beautiful girl i have ever been with. visually stunning, patient but forceful, and gentle, someone to listen. i thought i finally found her, and felt as though i was riding above clouds. then i just came down hard with the rain. i've never been the same afterwards, because everything was seen in a different light. this third girl at the dance, the rudeness didn't get to me, but the memories of heartbreak was just too much to handle. i asked tonia out to the dance once, and she came. but we never danced. i asked and she ignored. just like this time. love. i'm too young to know its true meanings, and too inexperienced to have any justification in even corrolating it with the words i or me. i'm always looking for """"love"""" for companionship without even really knowing what to look for. it can't just be the person that gives you that indescribable burning feeling within. too many times has that happened. i say to myself, you know what love is. you loved tonia, because all you ever did was argue, yet you could stand it. she broke your heart, lied to you, worked behind your back, carried you up and dropped you, and yet you still thought of her. hell, you still think of her. you've been talking to her as a friend and the feeling has never left you. isn't that enough to be love?  it's as close as i've gotten, i'm sure, but what about prom. to have danced with someone i've never known before, to talk, and to, after so long, have fun. when i held her in my arms, and her hair brushed my face as the slow songs played through, what was that feeling. was it a feeling of completeness, of safety that as long as with her that nothing can go wrong?  what was that?  i go through sleepless nights thinking of christie sometimes, someone who i never gave a second thought to until that moment i told her goodbye. the moment in which the swelling in my throat caught even me by surprise. but am i looking for love or just someone. i don't want to end up like my uncle, having married a woman only because she threatened to commit suicide. is he happy?  am i happy now?  no, i'm not.

"3:34 twenty minutes to write what i am thinking well, i am writing this at a time when i should be in class, but at least i am doing my homework. between reading the book and doing the writing assignments, i think i have this class covered. i must admit i hate missing class because there are so many hotties in the class. when ever i get bored listening to the discussion that is merely a repetition of info in the book, i can stare around at the hundreds of fine chicks in the class. don't get me wrong the class is interesting, but that's my thought. the guy that is sitting next to me smells bad. i know him, and has just said hello, the only reason i know him is because he is in many of my music classes, and his girlfriend is hot. holy shit, she just came in here to talk to him. this is really fucked up. i am trying to evesdrop as i write this. he is telling her what to do. oh wait they are noticing me, she left. why does she date him? he's so nasty. i'm hungry, i ate not to long ago, maybe i want a cigarette. busy busy busy, have a trombone lesson at five, still have to get my instrument from the instrument nazi. he was on the sick out we all hate him. some dude i don't know came up to the guy next to me and pretended to be him girlfriend by rubbing his shoulders, it was funny, i am really starting to get tired of this, but hey anything for a good grade. i am thinking to much abbot what to write. what to think. i am hungry, i wonder what happened in class today i'll just read the next chapter of the book, i like the book it is interesting. lots of people in the lab today, feel kind of weird writing, can't wait tell friday, actually every day is good when i am not in class and don't have anything to do. the dude next to me started talking to me, i hate him, i don't even know what he said. hey 3:54 see you bye ",1
"welcome to your life, there's no turning back, even while we. we will . whatever. i don't know all the words to everybody wants to rule the world, but that's the song on the radio right now. i can't recall ever hearing a song that i didn't like on kgsr. i think that i'll stay in austin this summer so that i can continue to listen to it. i really missed it last summer, when i didn't really do anything. no, adi can't check his mail. he needs to get his own computer, but then again, so do i. so back to the point, there isn't one, adi is not impressed with my psychology assignment. he wants to check his mail. that is why he is bitter. he won't leave me alone to concentrate on my stream of consciousness or however you spell it. lyle is not a man. she is the only girl i've ever met named lyle. adi will not stop talking about her, i don't know what his fascination is with her, except that she is very attractive and other things. but that's all i have to say about her, because she is just my very nice friend. i honestly don't care, adi. i'm not lying, i know exactly what my feelings are. adi needs to get the hell out of here. by the way, his real name is aditya, but americans can't pronounce that. maybe he should go back to india. like tonight. i hate the commercials on kgsr though. which is why i keep a cd ready for the ten minute commercial times. red shirt sara, as she's known, was talking about marriage today, i think. that's really scary, since she's only 18, and also because if she marries any one, it should be me. at least for a few days. and karen hasn't been around much, but she's kind of out of it anyway. rosy cheeks. jason has large speakers for his computer. which don't really have any meaning for me, since i never play computer games or do other things with them. i only check my email obsessively, although i usually don't ramble as much, unless i'm emailing my friend tara, who i tell alot of useless information to. my stream of consciousness is rather boring, as i've learned in past jobs. i've had to entertain myself before while working long hours with no one else around at non engaging tasks. i usually sing whatever song is on my mind until i want to kill myself. (not really-which i should mention since you are psychologists)it's just that these songs get on my mind and won't go away, and all i can do is sing them over and over again. also i sometimes translate them into french. it always seems like i've accomplished something after i've done that. twenty minutes is a long time to just type. at least i have the radio on to give me some sort of stimulation, something to type about. adi has since left the room, which is why what i type is no longer influenced by the things (girls) he is talking about, or rather, about which he is talking. its hard not to end your sentence with a preposition while typing a stream of consciousness thing, it's also difficult to spell consciousness correctly. i think i need to hear the new sundays cd, it sounds really good, at least the one song that i've heard from it. i haven't bought a cd in a few weeks now, my last one being an older poi dog pondering cd that i like a lot. my hands are beginning to hurt a little now. fortunately i only have two minutes left. i wonder how many people wrote about how much longer they had left. i know you can type longer, and i'd love to, except i have other homework and my hands hurt in addition to other excuses that i have available. so now i'm going to count to sixty, and that'll be twenty minutes. 60,549. 58,47. 56,55,54,53. that's getting old, although that really was what was going through my mind, only i couldn't really count down and type at the same time, i'll try again with the ten key. 60,590,58,57,56,55,545,53,52,52, no, that takes way too much concentration, but at least now i've exceeded twenty minutes. by one minute. thank you.

"here i am at ugl with hyojin and lois. they are both doing their homework and studying. all i've done since i got here is waste my time and distract my friends from doing their work. i should be doing my reading for tomorrow, but i keep procrastinating, so i decided to finish my assignment for psychology instead. there is so much reading to do in college. it's kind of over whelming, but i guess it's all about time management. i can't wait until the weekend. not for any particular reason, just because the weekend is the best and most relaxing part of the week. oh, and also, i'm going back to dallas this weekend with my brother. it's my mom's birthday. what should i get her for her birthday? i asked her and she keeps telling me not to get her anything for her birthday, but i'm pretty sure that translates into """"get me something good. """" actually, that would be me. mom's not really like that. maybe i really shouldn't get her anything. i don't know, i don't think she's going to have a very happy birthday though. especially after the news she heard about our cousins. what is wrong with my uncle? why is he abandoning his family like that? i think my aunt might have asked my mom for money. oh well, i guess my parents will figure something out. i wonder where my friends went? they just disappeared. i guess they both left while i was writing this thing and now i'm left all alone. maybe i should eat some of those goldfish. no, i cannot. i vow not to gain the """"freshman fifteen"""". i'm tired. i wonder if i'm even doing this assignment right. i hope so. i really want to do well this semester. yea! 4. 0! well, we'll see. psychology's such a big class though. i wonder if they're going to go through and read each one of these. probably not. actually, i think the professor was saying that they weren't going to. so i could just write a whole bunch of nonsense and i guess they wouldn't even notice. my sociology professor cusses a lot. i don't really mind, but every time he does it, i'm kind of taken aback. sociology's actually really interesting. more interesting than i thought it would be. maybe i should be a sociology major. maybe not. i need to hurry and declare my major. i feel so lost as a liberal arts undecided student. actually you know what though? all my classes are kind of similar. maybe it's because they're all sciences but they're all talking about scientific method and random sampling. maybe that's because it's the beginning. my friend came back. she took a long time. i want to talk to her and ask her where she went, but i can't until i finish recording my thoughts for psychology. my gum is getting really nasty, all soft and about to dissolve. i feel like my teeth are rotting. i should really stop chewing gum. i feel like my jaws are expanding. i heard that somewhere, that if you chew a lot of gum, your jaws will expand. where did i hear that? oh well, time's up. i hope i did the assignment right.

i really want a zeta to call me and ask me to go out. even though its c razy i would have loved to be dragged out of bed and taken out to eat at six in the morning, but no one every came for me, and as far  as i know no one ever called for me either. its a good thing because i needed to work out and sleep like i did and not drink. its even a wednesday and they took us out to party hardy, i don't know how these fgirls can run, because they even look fgood and have boyfriends and make food grades and go out and study and sleep. i guess its all time management and i'l;ll e\definately be forced to learn it, at least i have tom ake mysels learnit ior ill go crazy. i want to go call a zeta and hjand out with her because we will be friends one day and probably be partyingh together four years from now, hopefully. i think the purpose of a sorority must be not so much to give you a place as a freshman, whichis nice and it does do, but it makes a small close world for you of very cool poeople when you are a sopjomore and a junior. i don't know how much i would want to be conected to the sorority my senior year, but just the girls and the people i had met from being a part of it. it think  it would be somewhat like cheerleading was, where by your junior and esp senior year you aren't really interested int he younger girls, and you really do your own thing. but that owould be awesome anyway because at that point hopefully i;ll be absorbed into my new life and begining a career. i have to miss the first ut football game!!i wish the zetas had a section, but maybe i can go to the tailgate party anyway if i find someone to go with, and veronica will bve here. i hope when she leaves i don't geet homesilck like i did nwhen momm and the fgirls came up. i can't believe i've really only talied to daddy once since i left san antonio. he sent me a nice letter and a nicer jchekc but too bad that a hundred dollars won;t go to o fast. being at ut in austin i dfeel like i'm in a totally different world, and i ,\can really see whant they meant about not having the time or interest to go visit other campuses. i just htought about how much fun it will be to go to aand m tosee the cross country team run, but it feels like it would take monumental organization and effort to bget up there, especially not having a car. onely four more minutesleft to type. imi liking this assignment because it reminds me of the creative writing class wiht mrs cummings nadnd how i enjoued myself in there and the free writings we would have which got easier and easier to do as the time went on, and i culd see myself more and more on the paper,and the way my thoughts went. i really like journaling but its uncomfroable to werite and i walways stop to do it late at night when i'm tired and if i do it in the morning it is eems like i get latzy and don't want to get out of bed aftereards, and i have to re read it and see all the obsesive stuff about brett wihich i am forgetting forutunately and unfortunatley. the way it isi i'm glad i don't have a boyfriend, bnot because i can run around a nd get play or do stuff with guys, but v\beecause it hink it would hadd another huge element of stresssand i really don't need that right now. i thought vivian is so gorgeous and her bf is not that cute. andni told bvern to say hi to jason for me, hut to just because i liked him and thought he was a nice guy but not because i was interested or flirting at all, or had been thin,king babout him. now the says she told him he shoul come to austin with reza, and that would be fun, but i'm thinking kind of weird too, and i don't reallywant to party with reza or old high school friends if i'm there only because of veronica and jason who lives in san antonio. i know i'll have a fun weekend because thats the only option up here, but i hope i get lots of sleep too. all done ",1
"i am so ready to go home and see my family and friends. i have never really ever been by myself for this long. it would not be so bad if i had at least one familiar face around but i really don't. i am trying to get to know my roommates better but i guess it is not the same as knowing people and going to school with them for years. in my small town we will be friends forever but here i am not so sure. i really hope i can get involved with the church here. i think that will help a whole lot. i want to be involved in a spirit organization but the whole """"lets get drunk at every social event"""" really bugs me. why can't people just have good clean fun? i love the team and the school but i can have a great time supporting them without getting drunk, high or having sex! anyway i am looking forward to seeing the familiar. i love it here and am gload i came but i am looking forward to next weekend. i am really ready to see aron and my other friends. this has been the longest we have been separated. i pray though that if we can make it being apart that we will be together forever. i love him so much. we can talk about anything. it is great. we share so many things in common. he loves god and that means the most to me. it is a real balanced relationship. wow i cannot believe it has only been 7 minutes. it feels like an eternity. i have so many other things to be doing like spanish and reading for other classes. i am kind of nervous aout my classes. my major is spanish and i am not so good at it yet. hopefully it will come with more practice. wow this retreat this weekend with the church is going to be great. i cannot wait. i am so ready to be around people and meet people. i want to build good lasting relationships instead of just aquatances. it is kind of lonely with just saying """"hi how are you?"""" and then nothing past that. o well. i hope i am doing well in school. i don't just want to be here, i want to thrive here. i want to be the best that i can be with everything i do. i want to be proud of myself and i want others to be proud. i like having lectures and tests as apposed to homework, quizzes and tests. but then again, if i mess up on a test it will be hard to get my grade back up. i am shooting for a's but one or two b's would not be awful. but i am studying for a's. i need to start working out. i have been sick though but i need to start again. maybe someone might like to go with me. it is always better with someone else. i am looking forward to be married, hopefully to aron, becuase we can do these things together becuase we both enjoy the same things. i also wish josh was here, it would be so much easier. hopefully he will get into college here and we can hang out more together. he is like a brother to me and will always be. i really miss him. hopefully he will call back but i guess i will just call him again. well these are all the things  i have been thinking about for the past couple of weeks. i think about these things all the time and just think it has only been 16 minutes. i wish all writing assignments were this easy. i need to sign up for more experiments so i don't get behind. i also need to do some passoffs. hopefully if i study them well today i can do one tomorrow and one thurs and then one friday and the only have 12 left. that would be good. i wonder who is all coming home for homecoming? probably most people. i love my little town. i would not trade it for the world. those that have lived there their whole lives don't appreciate it as much as i do but they will some day. i am really glad my mom married walter and that we moved there. i like it that i live here cause my dad visits a lot. my family is awesome. they do so much for me and i thank god i have them. you know another thing that bugs me about here is that so many people are liberals. what is this world coming to?  i am so voting for bush!

"ok. stream of. """"come as you are. i wonder if anybody actually misses kurt cobain. """"no i don't have a gun""""?  what? this is really a dumb song. leave it to a group named nirvana, whose leader shot himself. blues traveler, much better group. i wonder how many people have killed themselves because of kurt cobains death. that takes intelligence. kurt's dead, life's not worth living. why did i wait till the day before this is due to type it. ohhhhhh i love this song. it reminds me of my boyfriend and i. """"when she says she loves me"""". except i don't say i love him because according to every one of my friends i'm afraid to tell him i love him. something about a fear of commitment and love. i guess it's all supposed to be nathan's fault, my ex, for cheating on me every day for a year and a half. oh well. """" when she says she loves me. say you love, but you don't speak love"""". good song. i wonder how many people actually think about the words of the songs they listen to. oh yah, classic sting. i have absolutely no idea what the name of this song is. i never really liked sting anyway. i should really be doing my other homework. what do i have to do? english paper, read my classic civilization, read my english, study psy notes, and phl notes. i guess i can do most of it tomorrow. third eye blind. where do they get names for these groups?  tomorrow is another day{go scarlett}. i really don't want to go to work tomorrow. at least i have a decent boss for once, not some 57 year old pervert. what time is it? wow 15 minutes really flies when your writing a paper that you can't possibly fail. i wish they were all that easy. yah right. that probably wouldn't get me into med school. medical school, four more years of college. hopefully i can get through these first four. i can do it, because i'm good enough i'm strong enough, and dog-gon it, people like me. well it's been a great 14 min. i'll be back at it tomorrow to do the other paper. i need to do these more than a day before their due next time.

"right now i am thinking about september 11th because i just got out of music class, and we discussed the emotional impact that music has on people. i never really thought about how emotional some songs make me feel. when my music teacher played   amazing grace   after reading an e-mail from a new york firefighter, i felt myself get teary eyed. it has been about 20 minutes since i've been in his class, and i still have that heart ache feeling thinking about the diffrent songs he played for the class. i also feel homesick. i keep thinking how i want to spend the anniversary of september 11th at home with my mom and dad. i am already homesick, and wednesday is just going to intinsify my home sickness. i feel worried about my school work. i have so much homework that i need to get done that i'm starting to feel stressed out. i wish i would have study more these past two weeks instead of leaving the huge load i have now to the last minute. i don't think i'm ever going to catch up! i am really worried about biology. it's an advanced class, and i have no idea what i'm doing in there. i still have an 11 paged packet that i must have done tomorrow. it's too hard though. i really wanted to go workout, but i don't feel like i have time. i want to go tanning but i have class at 3:30 and i needed to study inbetween my classes. i am really hungry. i want some buffalo wings. i think after i'm done typing this i'm going to order some pluckers. i am also really thirsty, but i'm too lazy to go downstairs and get a coke. i'll just wait until i go get food. my room mate won't stop making noise which keeps breaking my train of thought. i really miss my nephew. i havn't got to see him in months. i hope when i go home this weekend i will be able to see him, but i doubt it beacuse his mom is such a psycho. she never lets us see him unless she wants something. i am going to call her and tell her i want to see him this weekend. i think i'll buy him a ut shirt before i leave on friday. i put your picture away, sat down and cried for days. i can't look at you laying next to her. i wonder how jess is doing. i havn't talked to her since i came to austin. i hope she's doing better than when i left. this song sure does remind me of her. i hope her and michael are talking again. it smells like clorox in my room. i need to spray some lysol on here. plus i need to clean my room. it's starting to get really messy. i wonder if that's bothering crystal? she would tell if it was. well, i'll clean my half just to be nice, and so i can be more organized. i need to do my laundry. i guess i could do it later.

"is there a reason?  these questions have been filling my mind often lately. when i talk to my friends about it they say that they have the same problem. is this a problem that every young man encounters?  it kin of scary because maybe i'll never find out. also, can i ever be satisfied. whenever i gain something i find my self always wanting more. i am incomplete. i have pushed many limits and yet have found no real answers. some say a man with out a purpose will drive himself insane. maybe , a man with all the answers has no purpose.

"i have done these things before and i really don't think that they work. i had to do one in english one time and i hated it. i guess maybe it works for some people but your conscious of what your doing so it seems like it really isn't a true way to examine your thoughts like if you were simply thinking in a park or something right now i will indulge the assignment and try to switch my thoughts all around. i love scream, its on the tv right now and i like this movie. ;  i here that the second one is do out this winter so i'm excited. i really enjoy some of the lectures in the class especially the ones lately about the various functions of the brain. the brain is so complex. i used to think about the brain and wonder if my brain knew i was thinking about itself. hmmm, i don't know what to say  exactly. i am gonna play some pool after i get done writing this paper. i have a pool table at home so i am probably better than average but lately i've been playing worse and worse. it really frustrates me too. i hate when i don't play basketball for a while because then i go back and i'm just a little out of rythem or i miss a simple shot or something. recently i have smoked a cigarette every once in a while and i feel bad about that because i always pre3ached against it to my friends and it is bad for athletes because it effects your breathing a little because you can't breathe in as much. i'm being a bit distracted by the tv and my twenty minutes are half way up. i don't know i f  i can really   fill up another ten minutes but i guess i can because i have to. it really isn't hard because its just free thought but its controlled free thought because i've got the monitor and keyboard in front of me so i don't think your mind can wonder as much. along those lines i don't know if i agree with the stats that the teenage male thinks about sex every eight seconds or whatever because i know i don't think of sex that much. imagine if when you were talking to your dear old granny a hot naked women flashed into your mind. how bizarre and distracting that would be to everyday life. i often wonder what the stats for how much women think about sex is. i wish that they thought about it as much as guys, but if they did the population of the earth would be worse than it already is and we really can't have that lets see   mgmhmmhfmfm sorry . i coughed. ehehehehe  i think i have come to another point of not really being in a thought process. i wonder how weird the papers are that you guys get i would love to be able to read some of them . i think that you should post some of them in class  so we can all laugh at the similarities that are sure to exist between our entries. i don't know what i've been told . i like led zep but not all of their stuff. it is pretty good though . i wonder if classic rock will be around for several more decades . i hope so oh my time is up so i'm gonna go know. bye bye baby!!!!

"right now i am sitting in front of the computer, completing this assignment. i really wish that i had worked on this assignment earlier. i am now starting to worry because i have to finish calculus homework and read a few pages for engineering. and i have to finish that one problem that no one can seem to get. it is bugging me that i left that one problem unfinished. it is also bugging me that i left that problem blank and completed the others out of turn. i never thought about that before, but i do get bothered when things aren't completed in the order that they're supposed to be. weird. i just had an epiphany. it is really weird how you think of things at the strangest time. whats also weird is how you can sometimes say a word over and over, and if you say it enough times it starts to sound really weird. like a word you've never heard before. take before. before before before before before before. see, it starts to sound really foreign. that is really odd. and it works with every word, too. hmm. thoughts are all scrambled now. not thinking of much anymore. i used to think of how much i missed home. now it is not so prominent. i don't think of roshi as much. i still do sometimes. but it comes and goes. i am not going to let myself get trapped like i have before. it is just a vicious cycle. i feel much better this time. i have somehow learned to overcome sadness. i dunno exactly how it happened, but i have learned to overcome and bypass it. it doesn't consume me anymore like it used to. now that i think about it, i am really starting to wonder how i managed to do that. inherently, i think that i can get fixated easily;  that right there is a sign that i am bound to get hurt one of these days. and i have. but i have learned. the question is, how?  hmm. oh well. no matter now. as long as i can do it. that is good enough for me. maybe its the college atmosphere. being alone and on my own. in a sense, anyway. i look around my room and realize that i do not miss home. i don't know why. i missa family and friends at time, but i don't miss them. its weird. maybe its because i don't consider myself away from them. mysha said that this was like a camping trip, and everytime we went home was no different than coming back from a vacation. hmm. i don't think thats so, but it certainly didn't feel too different on labor day. maybe i need to stay away from home longer. hmm. that must be it. mysha got me thinking about roshi again. hmm. makes me wonder how easy it is to meet people here. it can't be too hard;  lots of people have already met people. i jsut need to go and try. steve knows how to do it, but he has nothing to lose, he has a girlfriend at home so he doesn't care much about making a lot of friends. comes natural to him though. i honestly think that that is the only thing really bugging me here. i feel an immense sense of confidence, all except for that. i am liking the way i am handling things, liking the way i have kinda built back my work ethic, and liking the fact that i can make my own decisions. i am starting to feel better and better about college life. it is great. except for all the people. there is something srange about the people here, something difficult to finger. a sort of fakeness. many people are geniune, but there are others which seem unapproachable. people don't act the way i am used to seeing them act in high school. maybe that is it. asians don't act like asians at home, for one thing. most other people act the same, but the asians here don't. a little different. a little meaner?  that can't be it though, i really need to meet more and judge. ugh. i feel like i've just cursed myself for saying that. i really didn't mean that. i am being too cynical i guess. but you can't win them all. i am happy otherwise;  i have met a few good friends, i like the campus, and i am close to home. i feel connected in all aspects. ut was probably one of the best choices i ever made. my dad thinks so. he told me the other night. i always hated when he judges whats good and bad based on what he thought, but he is right this time. he usually is, i've learned. almost always. i need to learn to respect that. i'm the one who's usually wrong. oh well. better late than never. time for calculus.

"well here i am in the same predicament. it's interesting how life tends to repeat itself so much. i don't like hearing music while i work. it get's annoying. but allanis morisette is okay. at least she puts some intelligence in her music. but music is distracting. i have a hard enough time sorting out all of the conflicting thoughts and emotions in my head as it is. i don't need music in there screwing things up while i'm trying to work. some people like listening to music while they work. perhaps they just don't have as much running through their minds as i do. i keep thinking of a million things all at once -- a million things that i neeed or want or should do. but will i ever get to them?  sometimes i think i will never be bored. i would love that sensation. to be bored. to think, """"hey, i have nothing better to be doing right now than just sitting around. """"  that would be so wonderful. but perhaps it is impossible for me. perhaps i will always find something to do. there is never going to be a time that i am devoid of all interest, all motivation, all desire to do something that my mind tells me should be done. even if i had no school work, even if i finally unpacked all the crap in my room left over from the move. even if there was no one left to email, write, or call. even if all that happened, which it never will, then i'd need to finally get started on one of my many self-initiated """"projects. """"  to learn more about religion -- especially mine. to teach myself how to play the piano, and the guitar, and the violin. to understand women. ha. i'd never finish that project. so perhaps my life consists of perpetual preoccupation. this is a stream of consciousness. i'm supposed to transcribe the thoughts as they run through my head. how is that possible?  that's like trying to describe what happens on each roadway in america all at once. there are too many streams of consciousness. there isn't just a singular stream. i could talk about the countless thoughts of how busy i am, how stressed my life is right now. i could speak of my love interests, my friends, my relationships with others past and present. i could speak of the things i want in life -- the never ending flow of """"man i want to do that someday""""s. i could gripe. i could gripe about anything and everything. i could turn philosophical. i could question. i could write my stream of consciousness about me thinking of any one of these things. yet i am thinking of them all at once. so how do i transcribe that?  and then i look at the clock. ten minutes gone by. i have just put into words a small part of ten minutes of my thoughts. it's interesting how i love to write. it's such a peculiarly interesting thing. i wish i had written more as a kid. i wish i had kept a journal. i did for a while. it's amazing to see you misspell simple words, write so stiffly that the page seems like stone. but still, it's you. it's how you were long ago and how you have changed to what you are now. one excerpt of time. what piece of time. on paper. people talk of time machines, yet we all know they are physically impossible. the closest we will ever get is a little journal and the words that describe what the pen felt from the emotions of the heart. but back to time. i can never stay on one subject in my mind for very long. perhaps that's why i find it hard to sit still for long amounts of time and read. i wish i had more time. i wish i could make everyone happy. i think i could if i had the time. i'm trying to finish my reading. but my friend wants to go out. hell, it's 11:30 at night, and i wanted to get up at a decent time tomorrow. i never get anything done it seems when i start my day at three in the afternoon. but he wants to go out. i guess i should; it's saturday night. but hell, i went out every night this week it seems. why should i go out this night as well just because it's saturday. i should stay and work. i guess it's good though that he asked me to go out and i said yes. if i hadn't of been waiting for him, then i wouldn't have thought right now of the fact that i need to finish this writing assignment.  argh!  i can't stand not to proofread things. i'm such a perfectionist. i had to make sure that word was spelled right. i can't allow myself to not proofread something. even though it seems that's part of the point of this assignment -- to not look back and simply type. that's near impossible for grammar nuts, it's a sin. but i guess i will force myself to hit that submit button in about one minute when my twenty minutes are up. crap!  that sentence ended on a preposition. again, these things just can't happen with my writing. but i will rebel; i will leave it be. i will just accept things for what they are and move on. (another preposition)  perhaps i should act my life out that way. just let things be, accept them as they are, go with the flow, man. maybe if i didn't worry so much things would be much easier. i stopped worrying about the music and it didn't bother me until i thought about it again. i guess i should relax in life. i guess i should go out and have fun and forget about staying in and getting caught up on my work. i guess i shouldn't proofread this. i guess i should just hit that submit button.

"this is weird and different. i'm not exactly sure what i should be writing. i really love it when guys can play the guitar. i don't know what it is but guys who play the guitar are my biggest weakness. i hope, oh i forgot what i was going to say. that happens a lot. twenty minutes seems like a long time. anyway, i'm listening to hotel california by the eagles and then i think i'm going to listen to my sublime cd. the beatles were like musical geniuses. i bet them and frank sinatra are the celebrities that got the most sex from random women. i would have had sex with frank sinatra back in the day. i made a list of celebrities i would have no problems having sex with- it isn't very long but i'll share it because i really don't care. it's not like i'll ever have sex with these people anyway let's see it was lindsay lohan, michael vartan, john mayer, and jake gyllenhaal. i bet john mayer is an excellent lover. no one who plays the guitar (and sings wonderful love songs) with that much emotion and feeling is a bad lover. huh, i don't think that made sense, it made sense in my head. i'm so glad stephie is my roommate. we have our differences but for the most part we get a long so well. sex and the city is such an awesome show. i think each woman has a little bit of all four of the girls in them. is it bad that sometimes i want to push my morals aside and do things i know are """"wrong"""". since i've gotten here my friends that go to other schools are bashing my new life style. i hate that they judge me. why can't i just live my life the way i want to? being active in the church youth group in high school was one of the best things i've ever done but now that i'm doing things that the church wouldn't approve of i'm noticing that i'm pushing everything i used to stand for aside so that i can """"experiment"""" with different things. i don't regret anything i do, but sometimes i don't think i make the best decisions. i'm happy though and i guess that's all that matters. i'm sure god is an understanding god. i'm not sure what's worse living my life as a straight edge or being taken up by the flashiness of college life. sounds like a lose lose situation to me. i really need to lose some weight man. i was sitting in the hookah bar tonight and this girl said she lost 73 pounds in a year and that she used to weigh 210. so now she weighs. 137. wow. i need to lose that much weight. i wonder how she did it. i should have asked her. some days i'll feel really self confident and pretty and i'm like well i guess i love myself the way i am so someone will love me for me as well. then other days i'm like """"fuck, who's going to love a fat slob"""". i hope i meet the one in college. i hope he's amazing in every way. is it too much to ask to meet my soul mate? that would be sweet. first things first though. i need to shed the pounds asap. yes. after this i have to study italian. that's going to suck. i probably should have done that instead of sleeping the day away. oh well. this week was a lot more productive then last. so this weekend i plan to really catch up and get my shit together. i really need to pull my gpa up. i want to do good. i'm going to do good. i just wish i weren't so damn lazy. bah. i wish i were going to college station tomorrow. i want to see my old friends but i don't know why if they're just going to look at me like i'm the devil. my leg is still twitching. that probably isn't a good thing. i'm sad pookie's leaving this weekend. i wish i could find someone who enjoys my company as much as i enjoy theirs. i miss chris so much. i wish every time i was with him could be like that night after the john mayer concert. he's so much fun to be around. i think i come off as bitchy and annoying but i'm not sure. i wish someone would tell me. i have the beatles song """"black bird"""" stuck in my head. i want to take guitar lessons i just wish they weren't so damn expensive. i'm so glad i only have one class tomorrow! yay! i kind of don't want to go to the welcome retreat thing but maybe it will be for the better. otherwise looks like i will be going to college station. we'll see how that works out.

"i feel stressed as there is not enough time for anything. will this ever slow down. always things, always processes. i am glad school has started again, yet  i am worried how everything will turn out. i am angry with my step mother. a death in the family has made me depressed, and happy at the same time because i know that she is no longer hurting and is in a happier place. i am frustrated with growing out my hair. my dads and my relationship has grown since our talk last week. i am dissapointed in the way i acted a couple of days ago. i hope my dads and my relationship continues to grow and build. i am ready for the heat to go away it is miserable out side. i feel dissapointed in myselfif i don't work out daily, and i probably shouldnt. i love my new apartment, but sometimes i feel lonely. i think i will like all of my classes this year because they all seem very interesting. i need to enjoy something to do well in it.

"i have way too much to do this week i am never going to get all of it done it's amazing that i have this 20 min to do this one assignment it is a good thing that the deadline was postponed today in class. ryan who lives in my dorm is in my class, that is cool, now i have someone to sit with. i need to study, i need to sleep, i fell asleep in the laundry room today. that's poor. at least my laundry's done. tonight i have to be in my room at 10 because my sailor sis is going to come do something to me or something. i am glad i'm here instead of home. home sucks. it is fun here and believe it or not less stressful maybe not less stressful but definietley less depressing. i'm hungry but i  have ot wait until 6:15. i also have to go take reality bites back to that girl that suzanne knows who lives on my floor. i wish kim didn't have another one of those damn mixers so she could study with me tonight, i have a mixer tomorrow when she will want to study. i better clean my room i bet my roomate thinks i am a pig. oh well get used to it. man, i've only been writing a little while. psy is a good class though. no i'm not sucking up. i like it it's interesting and lightly entertaining. bad time of day though-during when i want ot take a nap. wed. is a long day, when is the weekend coming again?  oh how i've missed the weekend. my stomach hurts, not from hunger but from ab machines. i just noticed that when i sneezed just now. i need to keep the discipline up with those ab machines though there is nooo way that i'm gaining the freshmen fifteen. i've actually lost five lbs. according to the scale back in dallas. maybe that is because i don't eat as much because the food sucks. i'm actually eating more down here because i'm not depressed anymore. in dallas, after my dad's death i couldn't eat. we sort of talked about that today in class--stress can shut down the stomach because we can live off of glucose in our livers--and i am sure that is what happened to me this  summer. so maybe i should perceive my hunger as a lack of stress. perhaps that is the optimistic point of view--perhaps that is the lazy ignorant point of view. whatever  my arms hurt, i'm tired of typing. i kind of like this form of writing you know where i can just say anything. is this like therapy or something? i always thought this was the kind of stuff therapists make their patients do. the next assignment is probably to draw a picture or something. something that expresses my """"feelings"""". enough sarcasm. i feel like i have to burp maybe i drank to much coke. at least i won't go through withdrawal. i wish ryan wouldn't go play basketball before we eat--i'm hungry. maybe i'm just bored. lots of people say that overeaters just eat when they are bored because they cannot think of anything else to do. jeopardy is on. i got a free t shirt last night at gregory becuase they were filming college jepardy or someting. it looked like a few geeks in front of a camera just standing there with loud music. i never actually figured out what is going on . hey that is cool  ryan just called and wants to eat. it is a shame i have to keep writing this for 10 more minutes. no wait five more. yes. i kind of like this its cool. i got nop email today. that pisses me off. i love email. the only thing in the real mail today was some anonymous letter about a credit card or some kind of bs like that. i already have a credit card. phone is ringing again. food its almost time for food. i wonder why ryan didn't play basketball. maybe he did. nah he wouldn't do that for 15 min. it probably sounds like i care a lot about ryan but i don't that is my friend's man. kim's man. he is crazy about her. it is all good though he is a nice guy and they go together weell. college rules. i think the water here in austin infected my bellybutton ring though. it's been oozing ever since i got here. i haven't changed the way i'm taking care of it but i don't know. hey i only have a little time left. because i started at 5:10 and now the clock ahs just turned to 5:30 this is me signing out.

"i am very tired. actually i am not sure if i am tired or if i am just wanting to be tired. it almost seems strange but being tired is almost like a way out, or my ticket away from always having to be around people. i ma usually considered the very social one, whether it is with my friends or my family, but i have always been the one that should be so happy. i love country music. i remember that i used to listen to it all of the time when i was a freshman in high school. i think that i might have listened to it then because all of my new friends did and i wanted to be exactly like them. i also remember that barron used to listen to it. i guess it made me feel cooler when i could sing along to the songs in the car with everyone else. college is so weird and i miss my mom and dad so much. i got to see mom today and it was so great, and now i really want to cry. i wanted to cry when she left, and now that she is gone i want to cry even more. i am not going to cry though because if someone walked in here then it would take forever and they would never leave because they think that they have to, and that they can somehow make me feel better and stop missing my parents. lizzie looked so cute today. she is getting older way too fast. kind of reminds me of myself. she has a really bad temper though and i think that she got it from my mom. she is so damn smart though. i miss having that kid say weird things all of the time. making me laugh. i have had really weird dreams lately. i think that travis must be really tired i wonder if he really only does like me that much when he is drunk. i have words sometimes. sometimes i just really hate everything. i miss jenna being able to tell me to go to sleep and everything would be better the next day in high school. jenna has a new best friend now. seems like everyone always has a very best, closest friend and i never really have just one. i am usually best friends with the guys. i guess that jenna and i used to be inseparable very best friends, but being in san antonio will really tear two people apart. i really don't want to read my psychology. i want to read harry potter. i think that i almost make myself want to read because my mom loves it so much. i love my mom, and i miss going to camp. i need to stop missing things and take some of my advice to heart. i know what is right and wrong and i know the harsh facts of things coming and going in life. i wonder if the sophomore girls had fun this weekend while they were in austin. i think that that is pretty silly that they came up here for a whole weekend as a birthday party when they can't even go out, except to maybe like a movie. i wonder if austin is really crazy about kyle and i wonder if brad has ever thought about getting with or dating rachel perry. i miss high school. i miss my megaphone and my big blue bronco and being able to want to go to college. last night i had really good margaritas. they would have been so much better if the were frozen. i want to meet vince gill. i hope that someday king sings to me. i want to date king. not just get with him but date him. i always like one boy and try to date him and end up dating his best friend, but still wishing that i could date the other one. i wonder if king's girlfriend is really cute. julie is here. she is so much fun, she reminds me of jill clower but i seriously think that she is so much nicer than jill clower could have ever been. i really don't want to do this stupid assignment. i don't want to do this anymore. i could totally stop and come back and no one would ever know, but i am sure that there is some kind of point or something and i wonder if anyone is really going to ever read this i wonder how george magel is doing. that boy never really changed since 6th grade. there are two ways to write 6th on this computer. i had so much fun walking on sixth street the other night with tim. it would be really cool if he would call me. i really was looking forward to coming to college and making a best friend that would be in my wedding and move to new york with me for no reason, and do fun things like shop for fruit and flowers and watch old movies. i don't think that i have found my real best friend yet. i wonder if people really think that you only have one mate out there waiting for you. i wonder if that is true. no one could ever prove that. the only person who knows things like that is god. my dad is really close to god. i really do think that the closer you are to god the better your life is. you may not be famous, or always have the cutest clothes, but you will know what and who you love and what is important to you, and those few, simple things that are important will work out perfectly, they way god wants. trust in the lord with all your heart and things will never go wrong. i wish that i could sing. that would be so cool. i love to dance also, and i can't wait to try out for pom squad. i love being in front of everyone. i wonder how lizzie learned to work computers. that is a weird kid. i am really bad at computers, you can ask mrs. allen about that one. mrs. allen would love lizzie. she is so computer and gets everything done, and understand computers. what she doesn't understand she can figure out also. jennifer welch is really nice but i hate the fact that she is so pretty. i miss sarah. i wish that i could decorate a room and rationalize as well as her. lately i have not really been so tired. i have been running on about 3 to 5 hours of sleep a night, but it has been okay. i really think that i could look a lot better if i had been running and sleeping more. i think that in a while i am going to go jogging outside, but i better do it before it gets dark inbox users: get your email on your mobile phone

"i do have spells of concentration where i can get things accomplished, and i guess getting around to doing this assignment is one of them. i don't know what happened to me in the past couple years of my life. i grew up as a bad girl--always in the corner in elementary school, only girl in my crowd to be suspended, first girl to try """"new things. """"  but in the middle of my sophomore year in high school i came into contact with a few people who made me want to change my lifestyle. i lived in the dubai, united arab emirates from 7th grade until the middle of my junior year. i went to a small, elite private school, the american school of dubai, where i was known by teachers and parents (and everyone knew everyone in our community)as strange and, therefore bad. my attitude was """"screw them"""" because i was angry at the world and dissatisfied with society. mind you if you really know me you find i am generally a good-natured person who looks for the best in people if they have anything to offer. and this is what my sophomore english teacher did. she was an amazing women, beyond intelligent, down to earth, somewhat of a cynic, hilarious, but very tough. a lot of students hated her at first but eventually realized she was doing it for your own good. but if you acted stupid she treated you like you were. but she treated me with respect straight off and i was slightly stunned. it sounds cheesy but she made me want to work to prove to people i had """"what it takes"""". i was always told i had potential and i knew i did. she made me see my strong points of analyzing literature and writing and from then on i wanted to do well in school. by no means did i become a bookworm. i had fun but also made straight a's in all honor'ap classes and i realized how easily it came to me and i was content. two years later, a year and a half after i moved back to the states, i actually got to see the recommendation she wrote for my college applications, although i wasn't supposed to. i think i cried. it was the first time someone who took me seriously enough to write and let people know that i was one of the few people who had actually touched her life. god knows she touched mine. now i know what i have to offer even if other people don't. but lately things have become overwhelming and i feel like my hold on my life is slipping. i just hope i do decently in university. i know i can if i try but i feel no motivation. i have no energy to kick my brain in gear. and it makes me sick. but i do have hope and deep down i know i can get over it. i realize i have hit a rather shallow, false part of life and i hope my interest in learning will give me a fat kick in the rear.

"     today has been such a long day. i thought it would never end. right now i am really energetic. im watching tv right now. im listening to the music video by styles. it is awesome. i just finished submitting my cal homework. im glad that it is over. my roommate is playing different songs on his guitar. i look outside my window and all i see is darkness. i see the lights around the stadium, since i live near it. when it is game day, i can hear the roar of the crowd in my room. i finally received my poster that i have been waiting for. it is a scarface poster with the quote,   say hello to my little friend.   i smell chocolate and soap in my room. its probably because i just had a protein shake and just washed the cup. i wonder whats going on at my home in pasadena. i wonder what my friends are doing. i have to drive home tomorrow. i hate driving long distances. but then again, i will have my sister in the car, so i guess it ok. im really thristy for some cold water. i hear the music video by michelle branch. i want to watch the movie scarface right now. i love to watch that movie. it is the greatest movie ever made. i wonder if i should do the frat thing. i think i would really enjoy it. i just wonder what the pledge process would be like. oh well, i pretty sure i can handle it. i met so many people this past weekend. i had so much fun going out and hanging out with my friends. i just heard my roommate say that he thinks he should me a singer. i think thats pretty weird. he can't sing at all. he sounds like finger nails scrapping a chalkboard. i have an itch right now. my roommate is over here complaining about his homework. he says he doesnt get the formulas. hes  doing the frat thing this semester. his pledge process has already started.  i think he is going to have a lot of fun. i wish i could type better. i need to figure out cal. im doing ok in the class, but i want to do better. i need to by some milk when i get back from pasadena. im so sore from working out. i can tell that i won't be able to walk in the morning.  i need to take out the trash. it doesnt smell or anything, i just want to take it out before it does start to smell. i need to sign up for a tutor for cal class. i think i will be able to do a lot better when i get one. i need to get a new cell phone. im not getting real good service right now, but then again its prolly because im always in a building on campus. i never really understood the levis commmercial where he dumps a car into the ocean but then swims back down to get a book. i also need to fill the water. i love the brita filter. man i need to go to bed soon. it kind of cool how people are able to tell so much about a person from what they write. i need to start working again. i want to get my job at best buy again. i had so much ",0
"right now i'm sitting at my computer at home trying to decipher a way to buy a new truck. how can i find the right truck that's cool for me, is affordable, and will last without much repair. well i guess the first thing to do would be to go around to dealerships and research prices and selection on the market. that sounds like a wonderful idea and tomorrow would be a perfect day to go out and do that with my dad, but there is one problem. which is i am pledging a fraternity right now and should be up at the house tomorrow to be with my pledge brothers. this gets me right back into deciding what my priorties are. so far since school started i have dealt more with priorties in two weeks than ever in my life. i have had to be more definitive with decisions and stand behind them because they are so important now. i want to do so much stuff like join a frat, hang out with friends from high school, buy a truck, get good grades, meet people, and keep up with my girlfriend in new york. now that's been the most pressing issue on my mind at all times. i got a girl that i'm in love with at school across the country and talk to her every day. is it possible that i can expect our relationship to work out?  i know i want it to, i know i want to see her and have things the way they were, but is that something i can manage. are we going to end up on bad terms because one of us is going to meet somebody and the other will feel left out, or can we trust each other and resist tempations and stay together. it just drives me crazy to think about what she is doing all the time. then i start wondering about my best friend who went to arizona and if he is meeting new people and finding different friends. i miss having the comfort of my girlfriend and best friend around because i feel i don't act like my true self around new people. i am not trying to be fake with anyone, but i can't be comfortable and completely open around new people and i don't like that. i just hope to keep in contact with all the people that mean a lot to me, and never sell them out to new friends because i would be preety upset if that ever happened to me. even though i got lots of new friends in my fraternity, they can never eplace the ones that i spent my time with in high school and they will never share those same experiences.

"today was an easy day for me since i only had two classes to attend. in math, i really had a hard time staying awake. i didn't know if it was because i knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. either way, i was very tired and at times, i just dozed off. in my edp class, i had to find information on financial aide. i also had to start a checking account at the credit union. by chance in the corner of my eyes, i could a brochure on financial loans for students. so i picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. right now i'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on friday. it's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. i probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 3 classes to attend. english at 8 in the morning is a killer time for me. i had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. i tries to call tex many times, but had no luck. now i have to get used to waking up early every tuesday and thursday at about 7:30 in the morning. it's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that i can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 3:30 which is psychology. i really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on wednesday, i didn't take one and when i attended the class, i had a hard time staying awake. i'm glad that i'm in college now because i feel more independent than at home. my mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. but it gets to a point where i kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which i think is contributed to homesick. i can't wait until thanksgiving when i get to go back and see the family because i really miss my baby brother. i would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. i also miss playing basketball with my 1tenth grade brother. he is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and i hope he makes it. he still thinks he can beat me, but that won't probably ever be true until i'm about 60 and he's 57. this weekend, i hope to attend the football game with my friends again. i went to the one last week and we blew away rutgers by a lot. it was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. a packful of people screaming and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment i have ever saw because i have never attended a college football game before. it was quite hot and i was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. i definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. i might even paint my face to show some school spirit. maybe not. after i finish this assignment, i will have to start working on my english paper which is due next thursday. i kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before i fully understand the assignment. the good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if i need it. my edp teacher also mentioned a writing center which i could go to if i have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. i think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. you had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. i guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. the one thing i keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. i may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since bevo's was out of them. textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. the good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. i think my time is up so that's all i'm going to write. i think i changed the subject like 6 different times but i think that's the purpose of this essay. so, that's all.

"  i am so glad that i came home this weekend. i really miss all of my friends and family. i feel like i need to be studying for some of my classes right now. i want to but i also want to spend time with my family. i need to go shopping today. i still need to buy an answering machine and some shower shoes. i really like ut, but i just feel so lonely sometimes. i am so used to being in high school and seeing all of my friends every day. i am so used to being able to ask any of them for help with homework when i needed it. i really miss them. now most of them have gone so far away and i won't see them for a long time. i am so happy that i got to see vicky yesterday. i had not seen her in a long time, but it is almost as if i had never left. i can't believe all the things that she told me yesterday that i had never knew before. i am nervous about going back to class on tuesday. i am so afraid that i am not going to do well in college, but i really want to . i feel like i am already behind because i have alot to do. i am starting to get hungry now. i haven't eaten all day and my stomach is starting to hurt. i can't believe that princess diana died. it is so hard to believe. i feel so bad for her kids. i feel like i have so much to do today, but i don't know where to start. i am so tired. i want to go back to sleep. i want to go out and do something tonight. i haven't gone out in so long, and i am tired of staying home every night. i don't want to sit at home and watch tv again. i wonder if mom and dad are going to go somewhere again tonight. i hope that they don't. i would rather them just stay home with me. i wonder why michael is acting so weird. sometimes he is nice to me, but then sometimes he won't even talk to me. i really don't want to buy anything today. i have been spending so much money and i feel like i am running out. maybe mom and dad will help me out and pay for a few things. i wish that the rest of my friends were here. i really miss them. when me and vicky were talking about them yesterday, it made me miss them even more. now i am feeling like i was on friday. i was in such a dreary mood because i felt so alone. i wish i could see more people that i knew at ut. i wish that my parents would stop nagging me all of the time. sometimes i feel that i can never do anything to please them. i ready to go back to austin. i can't study when i am at home. there are too many thing to distract me from doing it. i am really hungry now. i think that i will go and get something to eat.

"today i went to class at 8am. i didn't want to get up at all. even though i slept by 11pm, it was really hard to wake up this morning. i do not look forward towards tuesdays and thursdays. my first class today at 8am was all the way across campus and it made the walk there more dreadful. also, when i got up there i didn't learn a bit. you know how in charlie brown the teacher talks like wah wah wahhh wah wah. """", the teacher's aid voice just seemed to trail away. as the class neared the end, i left early so that i could go home and catch a couple of z's before my next class which was at 11am. soon as i got home, i just fell asleep almost instantaneously. for some odd reason, i had a dream of home. maybe i do miss it more than i think. by 10:30am, i woke up to get myself prepared for the next class. i left late and arrived to class late, leaving me to sitting on the floor next to the door. taking notes is such a pain in the ass, when trying to use your legs as a desk. i just sat there thinking about the repetitive information. then soon after the 2nd or 3rd example, i blanked out and started to think about what i should do when i get home (back to my dorm) and that i needed to study for a quiz the next class. after the very monotonous class was over, i head towards my dorm room to eat some lunch with my roommate. i think he is feeling the same way as i do, tired, hungry, nostalgic, and lethargic. after lunch, i got prepared for my quiz. i ended up studying for 10 minutes at most. i should have studied more but i wasn't up to it. after studying a little, i watched the news and then headed for a class. i also went to that class a little late. for some reason, today has just been an """"off"""" day. i think i did rather well on that quiz and the information didn't seem like it was """"out of this world. """"                 i guess the best way to track my feelings' thoughts for this 20 minutes is the way i felt and thought about my day. i feel like this day was pointless in some way and that i should have done something productive. it seems like i always feel like that. the only thing i've achieved today was canceling my friend's plane ticket from northwest arkansas to austin. she was coming to watch the old rivals play. i cancelled the airplane ticket because she found a cheaper mode of transportation. other than that i set up my new computer and caught up with the news in iraq and in california and also the hurricane in the atlantic ocean. i think i need to be motivated more. someone to tell me that i need to go do something or someone to go do something with. i guess it's because i am feeling nostalgia. back at home, i usually had someone to go do something with me or ask me to do something or whatever. but in this new setting and the freedom, i haven't done too much. maybe i am doing more than the usual because i've finished most of my homework and chores this weekend and i'm just thinking that i need to do more. i guess it'll take me a while to get use to the college life.

"i feel kind of nervous right now. i have never done anything like this before. at least not as something to turn in for a class. lately, i've been thinking about school and how this semester is going to. i need to start looking for a job sometime this week. one of my best friends is coming back from sacremento, ca this weekend, so i'm really excited about that. i haven't bought all of my books yet, so i'm hoping to do that soon, especially for this class because we have a test pretty soon. i took this class last semester but i totally slacked off and got a d in it, but i need to take it again in order to get into child psychology. i don't want to let my parents down again. my sister took this semester off because she got bad grades last semester. i know that i can do really well this semester if i really want to and i think that i do. i just really hope that everything works out ok. i guess you've probably noticed by now that i ramble on and on. i think that stream of consciousness is really cool. i think it was virginia woolf who made it popular. i think it was her. i  loved the way she would start talking about one thing and then that thing would remind her of something else and then she'd go off on that. i don't know how much i'm supposed to be writing . i think this assignment is neat. i hope that i'm going to be able to handle working and goingt to school. i worked at late night at jester last semester, and i think it was the hours that threw me off because i would work from 8pm to 1am. i live at kinsolving this year and i think that it's a lot better than jester. i think i've been writing quite a bit already and i think that this is my stream of consciousness. all that i really do think about is doing well this semester because i want to be an elementary teacher already. so i guess i just hope.

"     i am very excited, but anxious to be in this new city, austin. it is overwhelming right now solely because i don't know everyone here and am still meeting new friends. i enjoy all my classes but know that this semester will probably be very strenuous. my goal is to work hard and try my best to not get caught up in the social life and to focus on what is most important, my grades. i am feeling a little homesick though, because i am out of my comfort zone and surrounded by all new faces. i miss my family a little, and my boyfriend a lot. i am excited to be here, but feel a little left out sometimes. everyone knows eachother and i sometimes feel alienated. i am listening to cars floor by my dorm room window. which causes me to lose concentration at times. it is also hard when the girls here are screaming and running through the halls. especially at night when they come running in all drunk. i smell flowers all throughout our room because we have received so many from pledging theta. my roommate and i just got through with rush and are excited about our new sorority. i know it will give me a chance to branch out and meet new people, which will be nice. i am noticing, though, that most of the girls here are pretty clicky. it is hard to make friends when they are all always going off together in little groups. im not the type of person who is usually affected by those little things, but being without my boyfriend and my hometown friends makes things a little more difficult. i realize though, being here will teach me how to become a more independent person and that i will have to learn to adjust when things don't always work out the way they seemed too. i love the condition of our room right now also because my roommate is a pretty clean person which makes me a pretty clean person. our room is all tidy and neat. i know my mom would be happy. i really love this city of austin. it is so fun and such a party place. it also seems to me to be a bit overwhelming. i'm not all into this every night party life. don't get me wrong i love to party and all, but to a certain extent. i'm a christian too which makes living here kind of difficult. you become so wrapped up in all the constant parties and b. s. that you sometimes forget who you really are. one thing i want to do while at school here for the next 4 years is discover who i really am. when you take away all the parties and superficialness. what is left? i want to make something of myself in school and in my personal life. i am contemplating on whether i want to go out tonight with the girls or stay in and go to bed early. it seems like im always on the go here, too. there is always something to do and barely ever any time to simply relax. as you can probably tell i am a little stressed out. i notice it is getting more quiet in our dorm now because the girls have all left to go out. my computer just froze for the longest time so for about 5 minutes i couldn't write. so i am going to start again, because for 5 more minutes and finish my time. sorry. anyways, i am really frustrated now because my computer has been having so many problems lately. it is making me very aggravated. so in case you know this i am still typing after the 20 min time period, because 5 of my minutes were taken away because of this stupid computer. well, i am hoping that i will learn my away around austin soon because this city is very confusing. i just want to have a notion of where everything is. i hate not knowing my way around places. well, i am going to end it now because i timed an extra 5 min on my clock and it is up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     j                                                                                                                                                                                              m                        y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ",1

"it is wednesday, december 8th and a lot has been going on this semester. i am trying to finish the semester out as strong as possible but it has not gone the way it was expected to go. although the overall grades that will be received is not that overall impressive, i know the work that was put into this semester was the most put into to school since high school. the only class that was a disappoint meant so far was my psy class. with two test left, there was still a chance to make an a or b in the class which was expected. it turns out after bad test four results when everything felt as if the test went well, the goal of the class shifted from trying to get an a or b to get simply trying to get a c and pass. granted that the most stress of the semester fell during the week of test three due to all the health issues and having like 10 different assignments and three test, it was still a disappointing outcome but focus can only be placed on what is left. the last three exam are going to be pretty tough with a chance for me to make to a's and a b's if a perfect score is received on two of the finals and an a on the other. my only focus has been on the two exams on saturday but it does not feel like there is enough time in the day for every topic to be covered. all that can be done is to prepare as much as possible and pray that everything turns out right. doing well in school this semester would relieve the large amount of pressure that is a result of me not being concerned with school over family issues. it seems as though just when i try to get on track a new unthinkable obstacle just shows up. this semester the fact that i was taken advantage of and received and std as a result of doing something i did not want to do in the first place really makes me mad but i still have to be mad at myself for getting myself in that situation. next semester hopefully no random distractions will pop up and my grades will be all a's which is very possible for me to achieve. making it through this semester is the number one thing in mind right now. all that is left is to push through these exams and finish strong. all i can do is my best the rest is out of my hands. i have to do something to make it easier for my parents.

"  i don't want to be in rotc, but i have to strive for a scholarship. my parents can't afford to send me through all four years in college. i need money!!  i hat rotc. it's so stupid. left face. right face. bullshit. i don't want to be in the military. but to save my parents money i guess i'm going to have to put up with it. oh well. man i can't believe i slept  i mean overslept through nursing. i was there for only the last fifteen minutes of class. that makes two classes that i missed. chemistry lab and now this. i have to make straight a's i have to. i must succeed. my parents worked hard to see that i do. damn it. i would be perfectly happy living in a small apartment working as a waitress well may be not a waitress. may be a teacher . anything . i don't care how much money i make. but i owe it tom my parents. i'm not going to be like my brother. damn i need to buy some shoe polish and some brasso for rotc. gaw i hate rotc. i'm already taking fifteen hours plus four more hours or is it 3? of rotc. that is too much for a freakin freshman. at least to me it is. man twelve more minutes to go. i hate my roommate. she's such a bitch. she's a pig too. she ate all of my peaches. i said she could have one not twenty. i'm tired of techno music. i like rap and r&b. they don't play that shit down here. i wish sabrina would hurry up. i'm hungry. i'm so stressed. i need a break. summer was too short. i miss louis. i miss sex. i need sex. that'll relieve my stress. but i can't do that. it's against my morals. yeah right. why don't i have sex?  there are so many guys around here that would be more than willing to have sex with me. i'm so damn attractive. i'm like a magnet. i think that's the only thing really going for me. my looks. but that sure ain't going to last. i need to start concentrating on getting my mind fit instead of my body all the time. i wish i was as smart as other people. i want to be a pediatrician. no actually i want to be a veterinarian. but oh well. may be some other lifetime. hopefully she or he would be more prepared than i was. i love louis, but do i want to marry him. will he be faithful to me. does he really love me?  i love his son so much. perrion. perrion. i love perrion. i wish i could see him. i love him more than his father. i would do anything for that little boy. damn i hate the mother. i have never been jealous of anyone in my life, except for her. shelly malley. i hate her. no i don't hate anyone. i'm such a nice person. i couldn't hurt a soul. that night i could've pounded her ass, but i didn't. i have self control and i have maturity. but damn it would have felt so good just to break her face. i miss leona. i can't believe she didn't want to spend any time with me when i came down to visit. that hurt so bad. i loved that girl. she was like a sister to me. what happened?  my loved ones are leaving me left and right. soon daddy is going to pass away. no. i don't want you to daddy. i love you so much. why can't god give some one else his pain and suffering. he doesn't deserve it god. give it to fucking charles manson or that guy that killed that little girl in killeen. but not my daddy. it's not fair. okay 20 minutes passed. i'm done.

"i hope that it doesn't matter that i do not capitalize anything. i seem to type better and more """"stream of conscious""""-like when i don't have to worry about anything. i like it here at ut. i like how my classes are big. i thought that it was going to be a really big change for me. i went to private school all of my life until right now. my classes were no bigger than 25 people. in fact my psychology class is almost bigger than my entire high school. the hardest part for me so far has been homesickness. i really do like it here. but this whole independence thing is new to me. this week has been a ton better than last week was. i am a little worried about tomorrow because i have two quizzes - one in chemistry and one in medical terminology. they shouldn't be too hard because i've been studying all week. first tests are always worrisome i think. i am going back home to san antonio tomorrow. i can't wait to see my dad. he has been in la for a week or so and i haven't seen him or talked to him. when i think of my dad i always think of this past summer because we would always watch the atlanta braves games and espn baseball tonight together. i have always been a big baseball fan. i never wanted to play softball or baseball, i just really like to watch it. i have realized that watching baseball with my dad at night was how we bonded. he is not a big talker. he is not a very sensitive person either. throughout my life i have never really had anything in common with my father until baseball. i guess the biggest thing has also been me coming to ut. he came here and graduated from law school over 20 years ago. he was so proud that i decided to come here. i love to see him happy. my boyfriend is still in san antonio. he doesn't admit that he didn't want for me to like it here. but i know him better than he knows himself. we've been dating for over three years now. it doesn't seem like that long. i love him. he has tried everything to make me feel better, concerning homesickness that is. he calls me every night and tells me how his day was and then asks me about mine. he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. it's kind of scary though. i want to spend the rest of my life with him. but i am only 18 years old. how do i know for sure that he is the one?  i guess it is just another mystery of life. last week when i went back home i went out with my boyfriend on friday night. i didn't think that it was going to affect my mom so much. she was so hurt that i wanted to go out with him and not spend my time with her. it's hard though. being torn between your boyfriend and your family. but i spend all day saturday and sunday with my family. my mom apologized to me about how she acted. i told her that it was hard for me to choose and that i felt torn between the two. she understood and now everything is great. communication is the key to improving and understanding all relationships. that is what i think anyways. well my twenty minutes are up. i have to go meet my roommate and then we are going to go eat. until the next writing assignment.

"i'm thinking that this is a crazy assignment. it's only been 17 seconds, i have a long way to go. my stupid brother keeps instant messaging me, i wish he would go away. there's a menu on my desk to a sandwich place we went to yesterday, that was pretty good. i wonder what we'll eat tonight. i'm tired of jester pizza. it's really not that good. now it's only been a minute and 37 seconds. 40 seconds. stupid kid keeps i'm-ing me. good now he signed off. my roommate is reading the fourth harry potter book and i can hear her turning the pages. she is also drinking something and sipping really loudly, which is really getting annoying, but i don't know if i should say anything about it because that would probably be construed as rude and it's awfully early in the year to have her mad at me already. i've been chewing this gum for about an hour now and it's almost completely lost it's flavor. my sandal just fell off and i wonder where it went. my roommate stopped sipping whatever it was. i think it was soup. who drinks soup out of a cup?  aren't you supposed to use a spoon?  maybe we're  out of spoons. that's no good. i'm going home this weekend so maybe i'll get my mom to buy us some new spoons. my phone is ringing and i'm pretty sure it's my ex-boyfriend keith but i'm not going to answer it. i'll probably tell him it's because i'm writing this, but i really just don't feel like talking to him right now. his new relationship is probably not going well and he probably wants to talk about it so we can get back together, but i don't really want to. i don't like being the plan b. i don't think it's very fair. the page scrolled down enough that i can't see how much time has passed. i'm thinking maybe like 5 minutes. does this thing stop when it's 20 minutes?  now my roommate is writing something. my foot kind of hurts where my shoe rubbed on the way to psychology class. probably wasn't a smart choice of shoes. oh well. i wonder when that water bottle is from. yesterday i think. my printer has a blue button. i'm getting kind of bored of this and i don't really like to type. i hate e-mail and instant message and all that garbage. why can't people just call you on the phone?  it's so much easier and then you hear the tone in their voice and know if they're being sarcastic or not. sarcasm is completely lost in the electronic communication system thingy. now i'm staring at the wall. it's a painted brick kind of wall, which is probably smart of whoever designed this place, but it sucks if you want to hang stuff up. we tacked a bunch of posters up everywhere. my best friend kristyn got a bunch of them for me. too bad she is not here. we're going out to dinner tomorrow night, no the night after. anyway, friday night is when we're going out to dinner. i haven't seen her in a week, which i'm sure doesn't sound like a long time, but she used to be my neighbor when i lived at my parents house so i'm still kind of used to seeing her everyday. she is going to go to massage therapy school somewhere around here. i always forget the name of it, but it's supposed to be not very far away from campus. now my hand is starting to hurt from typing all this crap. i think if i reread this, i'd probably think i was crazy. all of this is pretty random. i want the phone to ring because now i'm in the mood to talk to him. he is not very nice sometimes, but sometimes he really is. i think this is probably a bad situation. he wants us to be friends. he is a good friend, he is just not very good at being anything more than friends. he is not a very good people person i guess. my roommate is rolling around in her bed, it's kind of distracting. i have a pencil from the greensheet and i don't remember where i got or who could have possibly left it here. where did it come from?  do people actually read the greensheet?  i've never seen someone reading it. kinda weird. my mom works for the austin american statesman, but she doesn't write or take pictures or anything like that, she works in hr. time must be almost up. ha, it does tell me when this is over!

"i just went to the union to eat chick-fil-a. i had a coupon for a free meal but they didn't honor it and i felt like i had waste my effort as well as my frined of walkin to the union and wasted our money paying for such an overpriced meal. now, i'm sleepy- i always get sleepy after i eat- especially greasy food. i don't think i have a weight problem, but i htink i should make more frequent trips to gregory to tone myself up. i don't' put much on personal appearance but it's not something to not take care of. i wish i could go take a nap now but i want to finish this assignment and i don't 'want to lie down right after i eat because i heard that it makes u retain all the fat in ur meal if u go to sleep right after u eat because ur body thinks ur sleepign and stores all the fat. i'm not sure how that works but wutever. i'm on aol right now. waiting for a friend from back home in houston to sign on. so i decided to check out the psychology web site while i waited. he's prolly in class at rice university right now. he's an engineer major and also my best friend. i have two best friends - kristina and stephen. me and stephen have only been best friends for a short period of time where kristina has been my best friend since the sixth grade. she's also in houston. i hate austin it sucks. i wish i was home - me and stephen are confused as to wut defines our relationship- we have strong feelings for each other. romantic one. but we don't seem to think a long distance relationship is ideal. plus we're not committing peoople. i'm awfully tired of this assignment and only 7 minutes have passed by. my neck hurts. i'm usually a tying sorta person. and i guess this is good practice for me- i use the back space key a lot - i wish i could type as well as my roomate jenny lau. she's an excellent typist. i'm just a scrub typer- i have bad coordination- i cna't dance- can't sing - can't 'type- can't play video games. sigh. i'm a good studier though. i don't' mind takin time to do things throughly-- i'm slow at pretty much everything i do but i do them sorta well. i wish stephen would hurry up and get on. he doestn' have his computer because it's at home but i'm sure there are plenty of resources at rice university. i wish i went to rice. he told me about wut they did up there and it sounds so fun i wish i could get in and i wish i could afford it!then i would sooooo want to go! i think if i do ok this year i could prolly get in. but i don't know abou the other part - i'm gong to ut on scholarship money and i thinki t's going to run out before the 4 years are over. i wish money wasnt' such a big issue in my life. i'm unemployed right now and i have no cash flow but out. it sucks. i think next semester i'll start a work study thing. i wish my parents were architects adn hemotoligists liek stephen's parent's - they're on their way to becoming millionaires. i wish this was in store for my parents. they make lousy money and htey have 4 kids and 3 of whom are in college. my brother is at the university of houston right now and so is my sister. and my best friend. ltos of ppl from school go there. my home town houston. i like it there better than here. i'm sleepy. 13 minutes have gone by . man. where are u stephen? i slept with his tshirt on my bear last nite. i think about him often. i don't think i want to start a romantic relationship with him because i don't think it's worth the risk. i'm an idealist and a romantic and i doubt my best friend could fulfill my romantic desires as a boyfriend. he's a passive person who lets other people control. however he's always in control in his mind. he's so smart and so quiet. he keeps all his thoughts to himself unless u pry at him. he'll open up to me more than his life long best friend brian. i think it's because i'm a gurl and i'm always nosy. so i don't know. i doubt we're right for each other but u never knwo these things we could end up married. highly unlikely but possible. stephen said that he'll save up his money and take me to hawaii- i know that sounds so stupid and so unlikely but i believe it he does get a job soon. a high paying one- like at a computer place like this summer. he can do it - and if he does save up enough money- he really will take me. we've discussed it and he said he'd really try and i believe him. i guess it sounds like i'm trying to convience myself. maybe i am. but i really want to go and i belive that he could make this happen for the both  of us. he believes in having fun and living life so spring break we're there! i hope! hehehe. ok. 2 more minutes and i cna quit. after this i guess i'll write my lil estebie an email - this would be his second day of class at rice. he loves it there. he' an owl all the way. well ok times basically up bye bye bye bye!!!!

"when i first decided to go back to school i knew from my current job at texas school for the blind that i wanted to enrich my knowledge in the fields  of the social and psychological sciences. i soon realized that most of the more detailed social science classes required psy 301. this brings us to the present. i have always had a strong interest in the ways and whys of peoples reactions to life. since i was a young girl people have come to me for answers to questions on their lives or advice of different content. supplying folks with this help has never over taxed my own brain and i have even found it to be very rewarding. i always chalked my natural abilities up to my own experiences as a child. i was ordered by law to see a psychologist because of the fighting of my parents over my sister and myself. i did the rohrshac(inkblot test) , the what do you see in the clouds thing and many other """"buzz"""" tests of the day (circa mid 1970's). anyway, these test never showed my little 5,6,7, and 8 year old psyche to be under too much mental duress and i was an above average student at school. i even skipped lessons in 1st grade and was moved to 2nd because i knew how to read. however, since the death of my father last year and the pre-grieving of watching someone be taken by aids, my need to make heads or tails out of some of the reasons and whys my own life has unfolded as it has , has become an intensified desire i must look further into.

"so today has been one of the worst days ever. i found out that i didn't do that great on my biology exam 1. and i aldo didn't do that great on chemistry quiz 1. i have been trying to do this prescreening survey for over two hours now and i am still not done with it. i am hungry too. i haven't had dinner tonight. well not yet. so the prescreening system is really not working and it is making me mad now. this is crazy. i don't know what to write. its hard to write for 20 minute. it has only been 3 minute. this is crazy. i wonder how long i will get to use this computer. oh, i don't know if my class code is right or not, but i think that's what it is. so we will see. i hope this is the right one. who knows. i have no idea what to write. i don't even know what i am suppose to write. i am really hungry. why wouldn't this prescreening survey thing work? this is very frustrating. i feel like crying now. oh gosh the thing worked and i want to get it over with but i can't stop writing. i wish i had started writing earlier. i think what i just wrote didn't make any sense. no i am pretty sure it didn't make any sense. i think it doesn't matter. i realized that u think faster then you type. well at least i do. may be because i type slow. but who knows. i think everyone thinks faster then they type. anyways, so i want to go finish the prescreening survey thing but i can't. so i wonder what liz is doing this weekend. i  have to study this weekend , because i am really behind. i make a lot of typing error. i have to improve my typing. i want to go to jcl and eat. then again i don't want to go by myself. i wonder if kristi would come. she probably would. liz needs to come get her book. i kind of feel obligated, but i don't want to call. it's her book and she should care for it. she should call me. besides no one ever calls me other than kristi. liz is a very nice  girl and i want to be good friend with her, but she  is always too busy with her high school friends. they are nice too. why is it only 11 minute. it needs to be 20 minute already. i wonder what annette wrote for her writing assignment. ok so this is not a great assignment. i mean its very simple. it's very easy, but it is kind of annoying. it's like talking to yourself, only you are writing to yourself. i mean you are writing for the class. who knows. this is getting old. actually if you don't think about the time it goes by pretty fast. ashley was telling me earlier today that she wrote about cookies. now that's crazy. well   now i am hungry again. this is not great. this is actually kind of annoying. i think i wrote this line twice. i am not sure. like the way i am not sure about my class code. i know i am right but its kind of hard to agree with it. ok so i don't make any sense again. see i am telling you , this assignment is kind of crazy. i know he is not going to read this but what if he does? he is going to think i am idiot. why am i like this? i don't get it. no i am really annoying. i can tell. but oh well. i am who i am. people should deal with it. see now i don't make sense again i don't even know why i thought about those stuff. and wrote it here. i can go back and delete that , but that would be kind of cheating. except that there is nothing to cheat about. you will be cheating yourself. yay. only two minutes left. no it is true if you don't think about time it goes by really fast. i need to stop chatting on the internet. i can't even write a sentence properly. internet does no good to you. well at least not to me. ok i guess this is it then. only 30 sec left. yay. i guess i will need to find more to stuff to write about on the next one. this is crazy. but ik  ",0
"i hate writing assignments, especially ones that have to be typed. i'm such a slow typer. maybe i should take some sort of remedial typing course. i wonder if they have those at ut. it's weird how stressful this is i have such a short attention span, that makes it hard to just track and write my thoughts for twenty minutes, the fact that i'm quite possibly the world's slowest typer really doesn't help much either. i wonder if anyone will ever read this. the copying machine behind me is irritating, i wonder how many copies the girl is going to make, it seems like she has been making copies forever even though i've only been here for ten minutes. has it only been ten minutes?  damn, i have to be in here for at least another ten. i'm so hungry, i wonder what i should eat when i'm done with this. for me, one of the hardest things about living alone for the first time is the matter of food. i don't have much money and i certainly have no idea how to cook beyond the scope of heating up a microwave dinner or making some ramen. whenever i get hungry i have to choose between fast-food value menus and basically, just ramen. i miss kinsolving food, there was actually variety and with a swipe of my student id i could eat as much as i wanted, and maybe even sneak some dessert out of the cafeteria to save for after they closed. i should make more friends who live on campus so i can get them to buy me food with their meal plans, or at least go home and eat some of my mom's food. wow, my twenty minutes are up.

"i cannot believe that i have only been back home for a couple of days and already i want to go back to ut. i guess in a weird way i consider ut my home now. it is part of my normal routine and coming home just messes with that normality in my life. i am happy to see everyone, but it just is not the same. i see things differently now than i used to and am starting to wonder if i even want what i used to. i want to go into journalism, but ever since i got to ut everyone talks of how a person should find that one thing they are passionate about. i am passionate about journalism, and it makes me happy, but what if there is something else out there that i would love even more? i am only eighteen, i could not possible know right now what i want to do with the rest of my life. i have a good idea, but i cannot know for sure. yet everyone expects me to know what i want. i do not know why everyone is in such a hurry to finish college and have a career. personally, i just love the process of learning interesting things. i have been waiting forever to go to college just so i could have the opportunity to learn about the literature that they do not teach in high school. every thing that we are told in high school is so limited and lacking in truth because teachers do not want to be fired for actually having an opinion on something. in my high school, nobody was allowed to think for themselves. it was a typical high school. academics were mediocre, but football was god. the athletes were looked upon as these heroes who meant so much to the world, when it other students who went on to some of the best colleges around. athletes fall apart with time, but that is what no one seemed to want to admit. some people thought all the jocks who went and got drunk on weekends were the coolest people around, but they weren't. in a few years they are just going to look back upon high school as their glory years, when there could be so much ahead of them. i do not really think i learned much in high school. i learned more in three weeks in europe than i did in high school by just experiencing other people's lives. i had all these romantics notions of italy and france, but really they are just other places where other people are just trying to make it in the world. i really want to go back there sometime. germany was so gorgeous, and i thought i would hate it. in the end, it was one of the best places we visited. most people do not have the opportunity to go there, but i think it prepared me a lot for college. i had to interact with a lot of people that i did not know really well. i also had to sleep on hard twin beds that remarkable remind of the ones in the jester dorms. who would have thought that beds that bad would be an international thing?! it is kind of weird being in a dorm. instead of having to drive to see my friends, i could just take the elevator to a different floor and see them. we are practically living together. i just hope we do not end up getting really irritated with one another. it just seems that if we spend too much time together things go wrong. we either start to get annoyed with one another and start doing the whole backstabbing thing or the group chemistry is just off. unfortunately, it can be really easy to do that too and that is when people start to think that they hate each other. two of my good friends are coming to school here. it really is a good thing too because i am kind of shy at it would be hard for me to meet people otherwise. i can talk and talk once you get me going, but i'm not really good at those first meetings. things always seem too awkward to me. then i just feel uncomfortable. i think that is why i usually just surround myself with a few really good friends. it is just easier to deal with people who know you really well than those who will base their thoughts on you from one impression. in time though, i should be able to relax and deal with all these things. i hope, anyway.

"there is drilling in the hall way which i find just irritating so much, i also find that i hate computers and i shouldn't have been born in this time period, but yet again all the technology i have now i can't live without. but i do find that man and woman both are getting lazier and lazier, we are all looking for a short cut to everything, i saw on a commercial that you don't have to scrub your toilet anymore because they invented some cool thing you can spray right into your toilet and poof all the yucky grime that forms around the toilet disappears. also they got that fresh shower thing so you don't have to clean your shower anymore at all. so if you don't want to go out and drive to the grocery store you can go on line and order your groceries. i remember once this randall's peapod truck fill with some lazy person's grocery came by our house looking for directions to someone's house. i found how funny it was that people are willing to pay people to grocery shop for them. grocery shopping to me is one of the most easiest things in the world and i rather enjoy it. lazy people! see this was why amazon. com was going up 15 points a day two years ago. thanks to lazy people, amazon. com stockholders were rich, but now amazon died down a bit. ok i did shop at amazon. com once, i'm not a big fan of sending out my credit card number across cyber space, i just don't feel safe, it's that insecurity paranoia i have. but i guess shopping online is sort of fun. but i feel that things are getting much more easier and i'm getting much lazier. i come to ut and everything is like technologized if that is such a word, but i mean i can pay may bills online! and register my classes online, and heck you got a website to make my life easier. i'm for extra help, but to mean all the stuff to make my life easier is bumming me out, i wonder if i am as smart without the technology because it's like the other people living way before or going to school at ut before all the new tech stuff was offered to them. i mean every student almost has to have an email account, i still don't know how to get to mine at all. i'm so computer illiterate and i want to be a mis major, isn't that an oxymoron. one day i know that i will have to eventually have to buckle down and start learning how to work a computer and not ask people to help me with it. i told my teacher once that if my computer ever breaks or my phone doesn't work i'll just hire someone to fix it, then he said to me, why don't you be the one that fixes things, some people make a living doing things that other people just rather hire people to do and they are making a fortune out of doing that. i didn't under stand that at the time it took me i think five years to figure out what he meant by it, then again i forgot what he said and then miraculously i remember what he said about some months ago and it made sense. it's weird that i have very few scattered memories about my childhood. i remember bits but never complete parts. it's more like images than anything mixed with sounds almost like a dream, damn drilling! sometimes i wonder if my early memories are actually dreams i had and i couldn't distinguish the two. sometimes i have these dreams that feel so real and sometimes i have these dreams where i know that it's really a dream it's so weird. i wonder is coma people dream about when they are in a coma, do they dream at all, i know that this could be answered if i were to research it but i'm lazy, and i'm sure that if i do some exploring on the internet i could find a website that is dedicated to answering this question.

"wow, this is incredibly hard to follow my thoughts when i am focused on this. it is too hot outside, i really don't want to walk all the way over to burdine today. my head hurts. college is so stressful, and i feel like i have a heavy weight on my chest. my roommate is annoying. she does not go to sleep until after 3 in the morning, and i can't sleep with the lights on. i am absolutely exhausted. i don't like nypd blue. why aren't there any good shows on when i am actually in my room and able to watch tv?  my head is starting to hurt more. i am straining my eyes too much. my chair is in a really awkward position with my keyboard. i don't know how i am going to write for 20 minutes. it has only been 5 minutes and it seems like an eternity. cherry coke is yummy. stupid computer!  it keeps freezing up on me. i hate technology. our room looks so unbalanced. my side is really decorated and my vi equipment takes up a lot of room, but my roommate's side is very bare. she isn't a very decorative person anyway. one of my friends is coming to visit on saturday while her husband is at the ut vs. arkansas game. i am nervous about seeing her. she is worried about me and wants to spend time talking. i don't know what i am going to tell her, because i don't want her to be disappointed in me. i am such a horrible person. i don't know why i am the way i am. it really hurts. she wants me to go and see a secular psychologist if i get desperate enough, but i don't like psychologists. especially if i don't know them. there is nothing wrong with me though. it is all a matter of learning to bury bad things inside of you. i miss my friend amanda. i talked to her last night. skittles are cute and yummy. they are so colorful. they cheer me up. my heel hurts from resting my feet on my hard drive. i am thirsty. i think i will take a sip of my cherry coke now. wow, it has only been 11 minutes. my tummy hurts. when i get nervous my tummy gets upset. i really need to wash out my cereal bowl from last night. but i am too tired right now. maybe later. the weather can't decide what it wants to do. it goes back and forth from being sunny and cloudy. i like it cloudy because the sun hurts my eyes and it is so very hot. plus i am allergic to the sun, and i break out every time i am in it for any length of time. so not a good thing. i cut my finger on my soup can the other night. i have so much homework to do and i don't know how i am going to get it all done. the psychology book is so boring. i can't get into it to read for any length of time. i miss my drill team. i won't get to see them until christmas break. it was such a huge part of my life for the last 4 years that i am lost without it now. my friend heather has a bad cold. i took her a care package two days ago. i wonder how she is feeling. ouch! i rolled my foot wrong. that hurt. when are my twenty minutes going to be up?  i am getting tired of writing. this is a very odd assignment. i hope i am doing it right. oh well if i am not. my head itches. hmmm. that's interesting. my lips are really chapped. they kinda hurt. i wonder where i put my carmez. just another minute and a half. hmmm. i hope it does not rain today since my class is all the way across campus. that would not be enjoyable. especially since i carry my laptop with me. well my time is almost up. ten seconds. yay i am almost through.

"well now i'm starting my writing assignment for psychology. great, just another thing that's keeping me from doing everything else i have to do. i still have another chapter i have to read for biology, but i guess i can do that after calculus tomorrow, i'll have a good hour to get that in. and i'm sure professor weiss will end up assigning another chapter or two for the afternoon class. is that my cell phone?  no, i thought i turned it off. ya its off, it must have been my roommate's cell phone. man the awkward silence in this dorm room is deafening. i really wish i would have just sprung for the single room. but no, mom said that wouldn't give me the ?college experience?. blah blah blah. all the experience i'm getting out of this is to avoid being in the dorm room. my light bulb on this lamp i bought isn't very good, it does not give off much light, but when you turn it a certain way you start to go blind, it just does not make any sense. and i don't know who the architect was behind putting these dang bookshelves in jester. there is not enough room for my computer monitor to be pushed to the back of my desk. and i have a flat panel monitor so that is saying something. i mean i have no space for my books, spirals, paper or anything with the addition of my keyboard and mouse. its just ridiculous. even if computers hadn't been invented way back when this place was built, it still makes no logical sense to have the book case as low as it is without completely attaching it to the desk. i mean, they might as well have just added 2 more shelves to the darn thing and called it quits. nothing could fit back there, its just aggravating. wow its only been 6. 5 minutes, i've got a long ways to go. i have to do my calculus homework after this, i hope that goes well. the last thing i need is to stress out over some retarded math problem and end up having it been typed wrong so there is no solution and you spend your entire night trying to figure it out when there is no solution available in the choices that logically fits into the problem. that is the thing i hate about multiple choice math problems, anybody can leave off a negative sign and leave you chasing your tail forever. i really wish i would have just waited to take m408l, i already had c out of the way, but i didn't want to wait and have all the stuff i learned in high school leave my brain and be totally lost when it came time to take the class. plus i kind of like the mathematical stimulation, its totally different than any other kind of study. when you understand a math concept, you really feel accomplished with yourself. at least i do, i'm probably the only person on this campus that feels that way. well on the other hand, there are math majors, so i guess i'm one of few. great only 9. 5 minutes to go. i guess the good thing about this assignment is that you can't really run out of things to write about, you just keep typing whatever your thinking, even if tends to weigh on the pointlessness of this assignment, its still something to write about, after all i'm thinking about it aren't i?  i still have not even read my psychology chapter. i wonder if that is even necessary, every other bit of reading i have done in my classes has been a waste. well not a waste i guess, i am learning something about the material and to discipline myself to do the work. i really miss my best friends back home. they both went to ut campuses at home. dallas and arlington. i'm kind of glad to be here at ut austin since we obviously have the more qualified professors and all, but man i'm just depressed without my friends. i'm not very good at making new ones, it takes me a while to warm up to people. after all, it took me 4 years to become friends with my 2 best friends. everything else just seemed like an acquaintance compared to them. they really are great. i just wish the felt the same about me, but i'm sure they don't. i'm always the one that over appreciates things. i guess that is why my friendships didn't really mean much, because i made everyone tired of it, i don't know maybe that is just total crap i made up. i tend to justify things too much when i should just let them go. i can't believe i have to sit through 2 sessions of biology tomorrow. if they were going to combine the course, they could at least make it be on different days. but no, they have to make it back to back, well not really back to back there is a 2 hour interim between the 2 classes. at least its time to catch up on my reading that i'll no doubt be behind on in a matter of days at this rate. i'm really enjoying chemistry though. doctor laude is awesome. i just hope i do well in his class, i hate liking teachers and then doing poorly in their class. actually that is never happened to me before, i've always done well in classes that i liked. i don't know why people become teachers if they don't want to help students. go flip burgers somewhere if you don't care, that way we'd only have teacher that cared and wanted to help us learn and graduate. it seems like all my professors will be like that this year. except professor ibragim, he can barely speak english, i don't know how he is going to be over the next semester. so far he is been ok, i guess. he gets off on tangents when he can't think of what he wants to say.

"     so right now i'm trying to hold myself together. i have so much on my mind that its actually a relief to do this assignment even though its holding my back from a deadline. i recently tryed out for texas sirits and shockingly i made the first cut. wow, out of 300 girls i was one of the eighty to be chosen. the bad news is that i have to do another   creative   project which equals time and money, two things that are in low supply right now. i hate money. people always say,   money can't by you happiness    but i beg to differ. if you have money then you don't have to worry about finding a place you can afford that isnt 10 miles away from campus, or where you're next meal is comming from. it really is the little things for me though. i would like that extra size ice-cream. or another ut t-shirt. however, mr. budget steps in {a good friend of my dads} and prevents me from enjoying the extra   perks   of life. i'm sure i'll look back some day and laugh or maybe this is just one of those challenges in a certain stage of our lives life. maybe if all the college kids were well off it would disrupt the order of the world. ramen noddeles would go out of bussines. taco bell would close down. and sadly second hand stores would be no more. wow i really need to finish my project! its due in a couple of min. i feel like i'm allways rushing around. my life is one big traffic jam. how is this? maybe i take on too much. but other people take on just as much if not more and they seem in control. i wonder if people think i'm in control? ha that would be the greatest prank of the decade! ok is ths almost over cause i really got to go. . yes almost.

"it was the second one for this job at the astronomy lab. i would be really excited if i got this job. mostly because the people seem really laid back and fun. also because i want to know about the stars. that would be neat to be able to impress people with my boundless knowledge about the boundless sky. i think i have a pretty good chance at getting the job. i was the very first person to call after she put the advertisement in. she told me to come in for an informal interview, mostly to show me around the place and introduce me to people. by the time i got there, 5 other people had called. today she said she had spoke to about 30 people and narrowed it down among me and two other people. i think the interview went pretty well. i concentrated on sending out a hire me vibe. i wonder if being the first caller will increase my chances. what a cool job. so john has asked me to go see giant with him tonight. i think i'll go. i hope he doesn't fall for me. that sounds conceited, but almost all of the guys that i want to be just friends with have a nasty habit of falling madly in love with me. it's really annoying. maybe i should concentrate on being just friends with all the boys and that way the ones that i want to fall madly in love with me will. this sounds like the null hypothesis that we learned about in biology the other day. it's something like making a hypothesis based on past data. it's based on the theory that all populations are alike and any abnormalities are due to chance alone. so if all the boys that i'm just friends with fall for me, all the boys that i continue to be just friends with will fall for me. at least in some way. i think i'm a likeable person. i think people feel relaxed around me. people are always telling me things and then saying i can't believe i just told you that. things just tend to slip out. so i may go see giant tonight. i think james dean is in that. my sister used to be a huge james dean fan. that's a main reason why i'm going. i love my sister. she is so smart and i was thinking last monday night that she has influenced me in many wonderful ways. i was at my friends house last night and jeremy started playing blackbird on the guitar. my sister and i shared a room for a while and she would always play that song as i was falling asleep. not because she wanted to play me a lullaby or anything, just because she was trying to teach herself guitar, which she did very well by the way. the other song she used to always play was, um , i forget the name but this guy was playing it on the street today. today it made me smile while the other night, black bird almost made me cry. i was in a sad emotional mood. i think i get moody right before and right after my period. the other night was right after. what was that  song. it's by pink floyd. oh well. i really want to get my cd player back. it's up in denton at my x boyfriends place because i wasn't' going to need it this summer so i let him borrow it. i'll see him in a couple of weeks. i have mixed feelings about seeing him. i'm excited but scarred that i'm really not going to like him anymore. i think he's going to move to austin over christmas. i hope that works out. i also hope we can find some happy medium to our relationship. he was one of the reasons that i was so down the other night. i think i was lonely for a male companion or something. and i sort of have this crush on that guy jeremy. his roommates are jill and leslie. jeremy and jill used to date, but john, jeremy's best friend who i'm going to the movie's with tonight says that jeremy broke up with jill and that's why john is glad that jill has found another really nice guy to date. but i think that makes jeremy sort of regret breaking up with her because you can tell by watching them how much they still care for each other. it's kind of frustrating since i kind of like jeremy now. this sounds like some sort of soap opera. i've never been into watching those, although my sister used to watch days of our lives religiously. i'm wondering if anyone is really going to read this since there's no wrong or right answer. the assignment was to write for at least 20 minutes and that's it. so is somebody going to read this or are you just going to check off names to see that it was done. i think another reason i want to get this job, other than making money, well i guess it is making money because there are a lot of things i want to buy. every time i go to the book store i see this little disc man that i really want. i don't have a cd player here, remember?  and i could use it in my car this summer. i really want a cd player for my car. well, if i get hired today, i will go out and reward myself by buying that disc man. i went to my friend jed's ranch this weekend. i came up with this awesome idea. i want to get a climbing harness and rig up some ropes so i can throw the rope over a tree limb, hook it back to me, and hitch myself up and sit among the tree branches. i think this is an awesome idea, so it probably already exists in some form or fashion. basically i'll need all the things they use to rappel down cliffs. i'm going to go the gym to check out the equipment and how it works to decide what kind of design i'll need. my 20 minutes are up. i think i went over, but i don't know by how much. wouldn't it suck if i accidentally hit the clear button instead of the submit button. i will have to be very careful. i just remembered that the other song my sister used to play was wish you were here by pink floyd.

right now i am thinking that college is pretty tough. i am constantly questioning my ability to do well in college. i want to make my parents proud yet i also want have a good time. i like to party a lot a little too much probaly. i just want to know how much partying is too much. i like to do what makes me feel good and school work does not make me feel good. in fact it stresses me out severely. i wish the world was a little simplier. i wonder if the way our soceighty is good or not. successful human beings work their asses off to achieve a good living. is that the way god wanted it or should we live a relaxed life with lots of fun. for me that would be partying spending time on the lake and going hunting and fishing. is good for humans to work hard and stress there entire life. maybe stress is the cause of fatal disease like cancer. it seems the more we evolve the more we work and stress things maybe this is leading us into different illnesses. i don't know i don't think one man does know. we could be completly on the wrong track or we could be evolving better than what anybody thought we could. i want finish school and be a successful human being but i would like to know if this is the right thing to be doing. all the human race would say definatly yes but what if we should be living amore relaxed less stressful and more fun life. doing what makes each person feels good could be the answer. life just seems funny because people are not robots they could do whatever they want but we choose to go to college and try to be successful. maybe people just go through all the trouble to make money someday but if you think about it money is created by humans and if every wanted it they could just give it to everyone. all of this might not seem logical but i am human and these are some of the thoughts that go through my head. i going to listen to myself to and not be something i'm not. i want to succeed and make everyone proud but also i am going to have a lot of fun!! ,0
"in the past i have always had a set of instructions to follow. on well, here goes. i guess that right now i was back, at the beginning of summer, sitting in my room in el paso, texas. this summer was really good. i got to go home and talk with my friends. in addition, i was able to do work and get my history requirement fulfilled. everyone wants me to go out and get a job. that's okay with me, but i don't really know how to go about getting a good job. you see, i feel that with almost 60 hrs of credit, i should be able to get a decent job. one guy i know is making over 50,000, and he isn't even out of college. i guess it's just easier for some people and not for others. i promised everyone that i would get an internship with a company next summer. that's kind of cool, but it is going to be a completely new experience. i guess i could call up some of my friends who have parents in business and ask them to see if i could get a job with them, but that just wouldn't be good. i want to be able to say, """"here is what i did, and i did it all by myself. """" i know that it's natural to want to get out from under your parent's wing, but it just seems to me that it takes forever. i have been blessed, though. i have done well in school, and fortunately i have a comfortable place to live, food to eat, and clothes to wear. sometimes it bothers me that i am more preoccupied with which movie i am going to go see this weekend than with more substantive subjects. there are people in this earth who can't even find enough to eat. wow, this is really getting deep. i don't want this to become a """"dear abby"""" kind of assignment, so i guess the best thing to do is to change the subject. i am mildly interested in why this assignment was assigned. i have a certain hesitation when i deal with psychologists and people who are interested in psychology because i always feel like everything i do or say is being evaluated, and that bothers me. well, i can hear my neighbors (they just turned up their stereo system. )back to the subject at hand. i am not nearly so stressed this semester like i was last year. i guess that's pretty cool because i am adjusting to the whole college thing pretty well. at least now i know what is going on with this school, this city, and everything else in my life. i by no means have everything figured out, but at least i am not as clueless as i was last year. it is interesting to look around and see the freshman, with the look of panic in their eyes and realize that i was in the exact same predicament a year ago. since the brother of a friend of mine just moved to austin and started attending graduate school in engineering, i feel a certain obligation to help him. it is awful to be in the exact same situation without anyone to help. anyway, the guy is really cool, and i think that a really good friendship will develop. friendship is something that there is never enough of. money can't buy good friends, and even though people will try to replace friends with artificial benefits, it just never works. i used to know a man who had loads of money. this guy was really wealthy, but he was never happy. however, if you ever asked him how he was doing, he would never admit that he was unhappy. i guess that is really sad. to be miserable is one thing, but to be miserable and not really know it is something completely different. i think that it is possible to elevate your situation if you are miserable, but i also believe that it constitutes knowing that you are miserable. rrahhh, my neighbors just turned down their stereo system. thank god for the little things! i don't really understand why people are always claiming they are depressed. i've been through periods when i feel down, but all i ever do is call my friends, turn on the television to a program i like, go work out, or a host of other things to elevate that situation. i don't believe that 10% of americans need to be on prozac, or some other drug which makes you feel better. oh, well. i guess the only thing that i can do is change my own destiny. even though it scares me, it is kind of cool. i see so many people who are in a rut, and it makes me feel like their lives are hopeless. i know that changing is hard. i don't really like to change. however, it always seems that when i do, it is for the better. of course, there are those times when you change, and it proves to be a change for the worse. that only goes to reinforce your opinion that changing is wrong and you shouldn't do it. i believe that a person should experience all the things life has to offer at least once. that way they can say that they've done it. in addition, they'll know what it is. you know, i always feel awkward when i am in a conversation that turns stale. (i. e. the kind of conversation where no one really knows what to say. ) that really is bad. it seems like i have been in too many of those type of situations. i don't really know what the future has in store for me, but i am both excited and apprehensive. it is easy to look back on my past and think that those days were the glory days when everything was easy. unfortunately, those days proved to be no different than today. is that the way it always is? your memory improves memories as time goes on? if so, i can understand how the past was so alluring and appealing to many people. i know a couple people who only want to reminisce about how good the past was and how awful the present is. that's pretty sad. i think that they need to start living today for what it is worth. that's what i try to do. i guess my 20 minutes are up. this was kind of an interesting experiment, but i am not entirely sure what the results are. i don't really know myself, and i don't know if it is possible to know yourself. there are so many different facets and sides to me that it would drive a person crazy to try to document them. i can't even do it.

"laughing, sad, wondering why?  failed dreams, friends, lost. can't seem to get away from people. why do people change, what happens later on?  help. everything seems to come together all at once and fall a part soon afterwards. people never grow up, promises are never kept. life goes on, right?  learn to live with people. learn to get along with those who don't attempt to get along with you. what have they sacrificed yet?  does anything matter except themselves?  sometimes you just need someone to talk to. to let understand where you're coming from. does anyone see what's happening?  how long until everything's back to normal again?  how long until i can trust? what went wrong?  somewhere, i lost the truth, reason, my smile, yet still i hurt and cry and need. i love this boy. but why is he the only one that provides comfort. it can't be healthy, can it?  how come no one else seems adequate anymore?  life has to keep moving doesn't it?  but why do things work out this way. what happens in the future?  where does all of this lead?  questions, questions, questions  i feel like everything is falling a part right in front of me. college changes people, and some people grow, yet some people stay right where they were to begin with. why don't people understand, or listen, or care?  overwhelmed, just overwhelmed. things haven't clicked"""" yet  lonely very lonely, need someone to talk to, really talk to and not just over the phone every night, not someone who knows who you are, or someone who cares about you, just someone who will listen and then talk back. who doesn't care if you drink this weekend, and won't judge you by your mistakes or jealousy, or stupidity, or friends. why do people always compare you to your friends can't you just be you, you don't have to have the same values as your friends, the same beliefs, or the same morals, yet people always seem to worry about you when it's one of your friends who screwed up. hate disgust disapproval attention  i need a hug, i just need to be held while i vent or cry, i need to cry to let everything out, but then i read that venting isn't proven to be healthy, but was it proven to be unhealthy?  and yet vitamins supposedly don't help you but they make you feel better, so can't i vent and cry just so i feel better?  why don't people change? do i have a one track mind'   why do i care so much. maybe i'm the one who needs to change, maybe i need to try out what's bothering me so much, but maybe i don't. i want my own bed, i want my privacy,  is it too much to ask for her stuff not to be thrown on my bed all the time, can't she set it on hers so that i don't have to move it in order to go to sleep, and if you come in at one in the morning and the lights are off, don't leave them on when you leave five minutes later, especially when someone's sleeping. i'm hurt, i feel hurt, and betrayed and i question a lot now, because i used to think that i knew who she was, she used to be a really close friend that i could talk to about anything, yet now all i see is someone in need of constant attention. so how do i know who any of my friends are?  or my boyfriend?  do i really know who he is'?  i think i do. but what if something goes wrong?  and i lose him, my best friend, also. what if he gets tired of listening to me, and gets tired of my friends or finds someone else, or gets tired of having to support me?  i'm high maintenance but is that bad, and not in the fashion that i like gifts, i don't really, i just like being held and talked to and spoiled i guess you call it  i really don't know where it all comes from i just expect more in a best friend so that it's harder to live up to so that there's less a change of being hurt or quit on or left behind, or scared or in love, but what is love anyway?

"     last night i laid down and i couldn't go to sleep for anything. sleep would be nice right now, i have class all day today. my classes are pretty cool though. i have music psychology and ceramics. i'm good at ceramics though cause i got grounded a lot in high school. high school was fun. i have a lot of great memories. i miss my friends sometimes, but it was time to move on. i feel more free, no one knows you or anything you can do what you want and be who you are. i am finally realizing the value of that too. i think its the art . i love art its constantly running thorough my head. the way i look at everything, the way i find beauty and perspective in simple and complex things, the way i am so attracted to things that are gorgeous. not only on the outside but personalities for example and music. i am going to incubus on wednesday and they are brilliant. its cool too cause my homework for music class is to go to a concert anyways. my music class meets too often . 4 days a week. that shit is ridiculous. i feel like i am taking 15 hours but i'm just taking 12, which allows for a job. i am going to work at the frank erwin center hopefully . i was a waitress this summer at el chico. i love mexican food. i am so damn hungry right now. oops can i cuss? oh well. my stomach is rumbling and i felt it necessary. i feel tired and hungry and event the sound of punching these keys is annoying but the relief of finishing this assignment is un-explainable believe me. lately i've been dead set on being responsible and i am hell bent on making all a's , so when i can make a check on the 'old to do list, its like its lifted from my shoulders and that no joke. my back hurts so bad every day from stress. its actually kind of funny that in class we talked about the correlation between stress and the immune system because i was stressed to hell the first couple weeks of school and a couple of weeks before with bills and work and money , etc. and i could not get over a dinky little cold for 3 weeks, and now that i've gotten into the scheme of things its so much easier. its so much easier just being a sophomore in general. i remember when i moved into the dorms my freshmen year. we moved everything in and i remember after my dad left standing there looking around. i had no phone, no friends, and no clue and i think it was the scariest moment of reality in my life. but when i look back i have learned that you can't always know everything at that second. you have to give yourself time to grow and learn and not be so anxious to know it all. what is this an autobiography? i don't know i am just writing as i go along. i like to write. i write often actually, sort of like this but mainly about things no one but me cares about. i like to vent, i need to vent. its almost like when i write something down it jumps from my mind and onto the paper and is no longer stressing me out. i don't know maybe i'm weird. i wish i could find really unique ways of expressing myself, so i do poetry as well. but i am getting bored with this subject so lets jump to another. how about love? i am in love. i am not quick to say that either and it is not something i was trying to do or even wanted, but i have found  my soul mate believe  it or not. he is perfect, and believe me i am not naive. he is the most unique person in the world ( maybe its the adhd ) and i love his mind because i appreciate things i cannot understand myself or find how its done, and he fascinates me. really all i want is to be fascinated, and to laugh. i love to laugh. you know those times when you just laugh your ass off so hard you cry. man that's the best. seriously. that's why i like to surround myself with people who make me laugh. i make myself laugh too. i am quite lonely during the day and end up having to entertain my head with humorous thoughts. or just dress weird and laugh inside when people give me weird looks. i love that.

"i have class at 3:30 today; i had better make it on time. after this i am going to go for lunch, i am feeling so hungry. don't know how i will be able to keep writing for 20 minutes, seems like a long time. parents are coming on thursday night, have to go and finish off the work on friday, better remember to finish calling about the computers today. there are so many people using the labs. i can't wait to get my computer back. we had better finish buying all the things we need this weekend. the tv people will be coming on saturday; i think we need to buy a video as well. i should call nimay and maallika and see how they are doing. i forgot to email cody again. better call him. i mean mail him. oh god, i am so tired, need to sleep some more. good, there's a long weekend coming up. i am so happy i do not have class on fridays. oh, now i do, sitar class. but then that is hardly class, it's more of fun than class. i hope he teaches something in the advance class that i can learn from. that monday class was ridiculous, doing all the basics all over again! just 7 minutes up. 13 more to keep writing. that guy looks familiar. better finish off on all my work 2day and go study for that accounting quiz. it looks like it's going to be easy, if he does the kind of stuff he did in class yesterday, then it's going to b really easy. i hope i do well this semester, make the 4. 0 that i want to. statistics and psychology look like they are going to be hard; i hope i do well in both these classes. winter break should be fun, am really looking forward to going back home. going home is always nice; it's good that mom and pop are coming this weekend. we should have a good time. we'll take all these people out to dinner; they'll like that to. deepti's parents will be here as well. we should all go out together. we should go to that place we went to last time, it was really nice. i think we'll go to san antonio as well this weekend, will be fun. i hope the weather is nice. i wonder which car we'll be renting?? i hope we rent a nice car. we'll need a big car. i need to work out how i'm going to get to the airport. probably take a cab, the bus won't be running so late. i should check up the bus schedule as well, probably have to buy it. better buy the book for that india class, and the course packet as well. i'll ask kristin and twisha to buy it. they live at dobie. i'll probably go to dobie now, maybe buy it right away. buy lunch there, probably go to their room and relax, i hope they are in their room. otherwise i'll go to malika or nimay's room and chill there for a while. jeez there are so man people living at dobie. so many indians, and so many freshmen. i think dobie is a good place for freshman to live. an apartment is better, but then not that great an idea for freshman. i think senior year i might live at dobie, only because it so close and convenient. otherwise it isn't a really great place to live. lets see what happens. all that is so far away.

"right now i am very hacked off because it has taken me 30 minutes to find this home page using this very complicated computer. i'm not used to using macs and it is very annoying. i also don't know why this screen doesn't scroll down. that is very annoying also along with this keyboard i'm using. well i'm tired of complaining so i will start thinking about something else. i have to leave for my home town in 30 minutes because i have a court date tomorrow. my stepdad will be here and i'm sure he's going to complain about traffic. i hope he takes me to eat somewhere because i'm tired of dorm food. i can't think of anything to write so i'll write that. this assignment is very weird and i don't know how anything can come of it. what should i say?  i don't consciously know what i am thinking so i don't know what to type. i'm just sitting here trying to think of something profound to say. that is stupid considering that i don't have to say anything important but i guess that is what i'm used to doing when i write an assignment. right now i'm staring at a picture of a whale's tale as it dives into the ocean. it really looks kind of stupid and i can't think of anything else to say about it. you psychology people are strange and i wonder what the heck you're going to do with all these papers that are basically garbage. are you going to do some experiment or what?  this is not what i am good at. just writing what i think because i usually think about 3 or more subjects at a time and i can't type fast enough to get everything i'm thinking onto the page. oh well. oops i made a grammatical mistake. this is very boring and i'm tired of typing. thank god i only have two more minutes of this. hey now it's only one minute. well, it's been nice sharing what 's in my brain with you and i hope you have fun studying what i've written for hours upon hours. i hope it helps in whatever you hope to accomplish. see ya.

"i'm thinking about robbie and the email he sent. e-mails. how could that be that he loves me. he doesn't even know me?  i should not have gotten so flustered the first time i read the letters. i should not have told anyone. now he has become a sort of pariah in my mind, a weirdo, an outcast, never to be touched by me. an that was wrong. he was brave and poetic enough to bring tears to my eyes. i didn't tell that to anyone. i only went off on the fact that it """"weirded me out"""" , thus i became the dumb blonde, the snob, simplifying this event into something that was """"weird. """"  now, after i have read the letter again i realize how beautiful it is. yes, he pairs me with his other love, marijuana, but even so. to him that is beautiful. he said i am what he needs. angelic, a blazing conflagration in his heart. and none of my letters reached him. they were all sent back. so it is as if nothing has been said, even though my letters were written before i got to the love part of his. how can this be?  an ogre he is, always high on acid or pot. i have hardly talked to him. before i left we stayed up until 3am, me, him and aaron. sitting on the grassy bank of the mississippi river. being attacked by mosquitoes.  the sad thing is i know that in a week  i will dismiss  the situation, knowing his explosion of emotion must have been a result of drugs. but forgetting his poetic words, and how i may have brightened up his life. he wants to write movies together. that would be great if we could stay friends with the same old people always, me and robbie and keith moving to california after i graduate, making movies. yeah, like that would happen. and good old aaron tagging alongside us, loving me. this morning the sun was low-- i am not used to mornings-- and it was cool. perhaps i should start getting up earlier. the girl just sitting next to me was very flustered. i wish i could have helped but i didn't have my if# with me. you know how in the canterbury tales chaucer capitalizes random words just for the hell of it ?  well that's how i type when i'm not thinking. i have a burn on my middle right finger and it hurts when i type. i talked to my brother and my ex-boyfriend on the phone sunday night. i was good. i am so glad i talked to woes. he wants us to say """"i love you""""  as friends when we talk. i couldn't get up the nerve this conversation but maybe next tim i will. its just so sappy and embarrassing (note that capital e).  he is an awesome friend , though. it sucks so bad that he is a fundamentalist.  i had a dream last night about adam. the one that is soon to be gone to israel for a year. i think i'll write him letters. he called me the other day here at texas of all things. but i had to let him go bc liesel was on the phone. then i called back and he was gone, never to be heard from again. in my dr4eam we kissed. like last summer and the summer before. in my dream he was in love with me all over again, in love with my smell. i was so happy and so was everyone else.  that sucks so bad that he's a devout jew.

"i don't know what to expect. by best friend's father passed away monday and i am really worried about the family. his mother does not work and he is in college without much financial aid. i hope he will be able to continue school, but i don't know what's going to happen. i am scared to face them, though. i can't see the family being whole without the father. they were always so close to one another and could share anything with each other. i envied that relationship because my family was broken up at an early age. when my father and mother divorced, i was only about two or three. i actually don't even know when they divorced. i really can't even picture my parents being together at all. they are so different now. i guess that is why i was envious of my friend's family. i never have had a very close relationship with any members of my family. i feel alone inside my parents house. when i went to my friend's house, though, they were always so open with each other and there was never any tension or anxiety between them. i don't see how a family like that could be torn apart, or actually why. some people think there's a reason for everything, and some people believe that it's all a part of god's plan, but i, personally, have no idea what reason or higher purpose there could be for this man's death. maybe there isn't any reason. maybe humans have a natural tendency to search for reasons, causes, purpose. are we all just misleading ourselves?  could it be that humans are merely just another species on the face of this planet?  who knows. james' father knows. he has all the answers to all the questions in life. it's funny that the questions of life are only found in death. he is dead, nevertheless, and i still can't come to that realization. traumatic experiences just never happen to me or people i know. until now, i guess. what the hell happened?  five minutes to go. i remember just before i left, coming back to austin for my second year, shaking his hand, and hearing him wish me luck. how can that man be dead?  then i remember that death is a part of living; death is the price tag of life. we all have to face it sometime, and i guess it's not going to happen at our convenience. we have to prepare ourselves for anything, but how?  i don't know of any way i could have prepared for this. if i would have known that he was going to die, i would have tried to stop it from happening. i would have wanted him to keep on living. why is that?  if death is so common, why do humans try so hard to prevent it, rather prolong it from happening?  i can't say that it's selfishness, i wouldn't want him to live just so i could live happy. but that is a part of it. but, the answer awaits me as well. i guess i'll have to prepare myself for my death. that means i better start living my life.

"     well here i sit at college and its kind of weird. in the next room there is music playing which i like. it makes me excited to go to a concert. , i remember the last concer that i went to. it was in good ole tennesee, and i was occumpanied by my cousin. now she is quite a character and at the time she was attending memphis university. she now lives in hawaii, what a tough life. my room is surprisingly clean today, which is surprising. i always imagined that college would be a messy room with clutter everywhere. actually it is quite organized. i have never considered myself an oraganized person, but as i have grown older i have realized that indeed i do enjoy some sense of organization. my roomate is telling a prettye funny story in the next room, and it leads me to thinking of all of the stories that i have. coming from midland, it was quite enjoyable to hear that my teacher was indeed from midland. a friend away from home you could say. my connection in the bussiness. . haha, i didnt always live there though, i came from the next town and it was quite a change moving there too. im not sure how it all compares to moving to college, but i do remember that it was right before i entered high school and it was still a major adjustment. i went home this weekend and watched my old football team play. my high school that is. now we have had a winning tradition over the past few years that included a state championship and playoff trips every year. that is beside the point now, because i witnessed a beating worse than i could have imagined on that friday night. nothing could go right. i miss football now that its gone, but i also know that the players here are very big and strong and would rip me in half. you never know though, with alittle hard work, next year i coujld step on the field in burnt orange. i have not written much lately, and i know that i should have been writing every day. i once read that writing everyday is the only way to improve your craft. that and reading, but i know that i will have no shortage of reading this year. i have already had tons of reading, but its not that bad. i enjoy reading. i guess this kind of writing is a form of rambling. when your thoughts kind of slow down, its hard to keep writing. you think that you should be thinking of something meaningful. somthing that would inspire whoever reads this. inspire or say something meaningful. its hard to stand out in a place as big as this. with so many numbers you have to be somewhat unique. you can't be too unique or people will dismiss you as trying too hard, but at the same time you can't be ordinary. you have to find the median. the happy place you could say. not only happy for you, but the place that gets you happy with others. you can't just sit back anymore and wait for somthing to happen. you have to make it happen. as clich'e as it sounds, its true. in the words of mick jagger and the stones,   you can't always get what you want. .   you could say that they truly are wise old men. you can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, then you might find, you get what you need. amen brother. spoken by a true poet. i have always liked comedy in my writing. not that everything is always funny, but it adds a sense of connection to the reader. i mean if someone laughs as they read, the work actually does something for them. if they simply sit and read words on a page, then it means nothing. it was a wasted tree. often times the reader would rather look at a tree than read what is on the page. i by no means claim to be a great writer nor do i claim to make people laugh, i am simply claiming that i like to laugh as i read. i enjoy to read a sentence that makes me laugh out loud. if it makes you stand up and dance, well there you go brother welcome to the world of reading. it is a shame that i do not write as much as i used to. the ideas are there, i just have not gotten them out yet. they will be there, it will just take time. i guess that is a premature assumption that the ideas will be there. my memory is not the greatest right now, at 19 years old. when i hit seventy or beyond, i can't wait until i have to write my name on my hand just to remember it. .

"right now i feel really happy and anxious because my family is coming to visit me. i miss them so much. this morning i felt different because they called me last night to tell me that they were not going to be able to come. this morning they called me to tell me they were anyways. now i feel much better. i even felt like eating. there are mornings when i don't have an apetite. i have been thinking about college lately. i like it here but there are sometimes when i feel lonely. i wish i was with my family. but, i guess i have to learn to be by myself so i can know myself better. lately i have been thinking about transfering to uta. but i fear that my classes won't transfer. i really have to think about this one really carefull. right now i also feel a little worried because i have so much homework to do. i don't even know where to start. right now i feel like talking to my friends from high school but i don't have their phone numbers or their emails. i wish i could talk to a few of them, to see how they are doing and what their plans are for the future. i never thought that this assignment will be so easy. the thing that i most hate is this kind of assigment because i run out of things to say (like right now). oh, today is my mom's birthday. this was one of the things i was sad about, yesterday. this would have been the first time i would have been away from home on her birthday. i really would like the 20 minutes to be over right now because i have a lot of stuff to do. the past two weeks i have notice how important tv is for me. i have to plan all of my life around tv. i can wait untill tonight when i get to watch my favorite program. i wish i could be someone famous right now. i don't care if is a model, actress, dancer or whatever but i would like to be famous. i also would like to live in miami. this summer was the first time i ever visited miami and loved it with all my heart. hope one day i will move there and be like all the people from there. they all look like models, beautiful and well dressed. they all have incredible cars and clubs and restaurants. i can't wait untill november when i go to ricky martin's concert, its going to be incredeble.

"well i just got don't talking to my brother. he is doing well. that is good becasue i worry about him, and i don't even worry about him that much until i hear him say that he eats lunch and dinner alone. he is only a freshmen at uta and it's only been like a week and he has to have time to make friends but he is just not as good as i am at making friends. my mom worries about him too, so that makes me worry even more. it is cold in here. i wish it was warmer, but i have one roommate who likes it hot and one who likes it cold and the one who likes it cold is in the living room and i can't exactly argue since she pays rent here too. oh well. she is watching csi, which is not something i terribly care for, its an ok show but i have different things that i watch. her and i tried to go to the gym earlier to play racquetball bt all the courts were full, so we reserved one for tomorrow, but who knows what is going on tomorrow. we rode our bikes there and it is so hot outside, i cannot wait until it gets cold, although i will complain then too but at least the cold is more easy to deal with then the heat at least to me. god the tv is loud, i don't know why its so loud, its just me and her in the room. i have a lot to do and i am putting it off. i have math homework due next wednesday and i need to get it don't before this weekend because my boyfriend is going back home to houston and he is my help for that class. i understand just about nothing in that class and it scares me. he is very patient with me and i love him and are very grateful to him that he takes time out of his homework to help me with mine. right now his roommates are mad at him because all he does now is hang out with me and they don't understand why, well they understand but hey don't like it and i cannot help it, its his choice. i am worried about chemistry, i understand nothing in that class either. i thought i was good at chemistry, i wanted to be a pharmacist but now i just don't know and that scares me too. i am feeling extremely overwhelmed with everything right now. ut is a lot different from utsa. my neck hurts and i don't know why, i didn't get to work out today, since the racquetball courts are full. my roommate just asked me if she could use my garlic. i don't really mind but she always throws a fit when i ask to borrow her stuff, not like its a big deal or anything it just gets on my nerves every now and then. i am so scared about chemistry, i have to ask my boyfriends roommate this weekend to help me figure it out. we have a quiz on tuesday over the stuff we have been learning although i feel like i have not been learning anything. it worries me so much, i feel like i have no direction again. i don't know what i want to be or what i want my major to be and my parents kept asking me and my advisor told me to just choose so i chose pharmacy and now with the chemistry part being so hard and i thought i was going to be good at it, i am scared that i won't be able to be a pharmacist anymore and that will only disappoint me and my parents. i feel like i have no direction and i can't just force myself to have one. i wish that i had something i was really good at but i don't. i have a lot of things that i am good at but not one thing that i really excel in and sometimes that hurts my feelings and makes me feel bad about who i am. wow already been 13 minutes time goes by fast when you just keep typing. i need to shave my legs, now it smells gross in here because of the amount of garlic my roommate used. my arms are starting to hurt because of all the typing only 6 minutes to go. this writing thing is not that bad i think its a good idea i hope thy don't mind all my grammatical errors and or misspellings, why does my neck hurt!  i need to repaint my toenail, i keep messing them up because i won't let them dry all the way before i put my shoes back on. i wish my boyfriend would hurry up and come home at work no actually i am glad that he is working , he needs the money. our three year anniversary is coming up and i have nothing to get him, no idea whatsoever and neither of us have the money to do anything really special so i don't know exactly how this is going to work this year. man i wish i could get motivated to learn that chemistry stuff but i already feel so behind that it makes me discouraged to even try now. i know i will try but i just don't know i just wish that i knew what was going on in there. i was so good at it in high school and that was back in 10th grade and i remember some stuff that he has talked about but not hardly most of it and now i feel behind like i am not going to be able to catch up. i wish that it was not in such a big room i think that is part of my problem, i am not getting the basic review that i need to refresh my memory form so long ago but i guess that is partly my fault, i should be reading, and i am going to as soon as i can motivate myself and tell myself that i can do it and that i am good at it and that i do have a future being good at something.

"i'm pretty stressed out right now, i just have to get this paper out of the way so i can start on my other 615 hours of homework. what is going through my mind right now, hmmm i haven't called home enough. i've skipped biology too many times, but i still need an a. i think the teacher is throwing way too much at us for this to only be a 2 hour class. i can get through it though. what is going on in my mind right now?? actually, i'm thinking i need to think of something interesting to write about so the person who has to read all these doesn't slip into a coma and die. i have a date tomorrow night with a girl that i hardly know, but she was cute enough i don't know what i think about this date thing every weekend, it is getting very old way too fast. how is that supposed to help me adapt to college life. a date is not necessary for every single event, especially when i am dressed up as country club ken (by choice of course). i just heard from someone that this socalled hot date i have has some personal issues. what is that supposed to mean? no one would go into detail, just that she had issues. she could be a bulimic head case for all i know or it could be something simple like she is very into herself. i have a friend who always says that about someone else, but they couldn't describe it. i'm worried about my roommate. he acts strait but every once in a while i catch him staring at me when i get out of the shower. now that i think about it, it is extremely hard to write about my constant thoughts, because you have to put effort into typing it out, you cannot just think. in class, that is when i can think continuously without interruption, the things that go through my mind in one hour of lecture can begin with some girl i saw looking at me and end up with my thoughts about my first exam next week. there is one good looking girl on my floor that i keep going back to, i winder if she has issues as well. i have been to her room a couple of times, but i can't decide if it could happen or not, i do not like to go for things unless i am absolutely positive she will say yes. maybe i think about girls too much, but i am a college freshman boy and what else do we think about besides school occasionally and my lack of money by the second week of the month. how in the world does that always happen to me once i get on my own, i could always manage money at home, but the day i moved up here it just disappeared and now i am already left with hardly nothing. people always told me that, but i never listened.

"i hope i am doing this write!  i never really used the internet before and it took me forever to try and figure out how to log on. i feel better now that i am actually doing this, i thought i wouldn't figure it out in time then i would get a zero and bring my grade down. i am a freshman and i really want to do good. i hope my roommate isn't wandering where i am. we were supposed to do laundry after my class which was your class and ended at5. i was glad it wasn't raining when i got out because i didn't bring my umbrella. i am kind of upset that i couldn't find a smaller one than the huge one i brought. i don't want to look like a dork. i miss my boyfriend he is in san antonio where i am from. i wish he would've gotten in to ut like me. it would have been so much fun being here with him without parents always watching over us. my time on this machine expires in ten minutes and it doesn't seem like enough time but it was almost twenty minutes that i have been typing maybe a few minutes less but it took me a while to figure out how to get here anyway. i not a very fast typer so i hope i have written enough and about the write topic that is whatever i am thinking. well thank god i am almost done i only have one more minute so i have to push the submit button before it cuts me  off. bye.

"i should have done this assingment sooner. it is a different type of assignment from ones i usually get. it is hard to write out what i am thinking about. i can't seem to put my thoughts into words, or maybe i can but i just don't want to tell anyone about somethings that i think about, especially someone i don't really know. i think that is the reason i put off this assignment for so long. i didn't know if i wanted to just pour out all of my thoughts into this assignment. i don't know if i thought i would be ambarrassed with my thoughts or if i just wanted to keep them secret. not that any of them would be embarrassing. i think that i mostly  just didn't want to have to write them down. it doesn't seem that writing down your thoughts would be very difficult, but once you actually sit down and try to track your thoughts your mind goes blank, or you try to think of something interesting to think about. i was thinking about going to work tonight and wondering if i would actually get off at nine. i also thought about an internet friend from kansas who i haven't talked to in a while. but i didn't think those were too interesting to write about so i began to think about other things. it is amazing how you can think about so many different things sometimes and at others times you can't think of anything. just the other day, i was trying to write a philosophy paper and i thought i would be able to write it very easily. but when i actually sat down and began to put my thoughts into words on the paper it came to be extremely difficult. i knew what i wanted to say but it was hard for me to elaborate my thoughts to fill two pages for the assignment. i became frustrated and disappointed with myself brecause i couldn't expand my thoughts. i believe that i could have written a beautiful paper but at the times i sat down to work on it my brain seemed to go blank and i couldn't think of the right words to use or how to make my sentences make sense. i htink that i have this problem often, but usually i can overcome my """"writer's block"""" simply by putting the assignment away for a while and trying to write again later. i think that is another reason i put this assignment off for so long. i made it seem harder than it really is and made myself have """"writer's block. """"  i seemed to not be thinking about anything so i couldn't just put my thoughts down. i was also worried about writing about the right things, but i realized it doesn't mater what i write about, it is just supposed to be what i am thinking. these twenty minutes have actually gone by pretty fast and i feel good about myself for just getting this assignment done and not procrastinating any more. i have definetly learned to do these assignments right away and that i don't have to think too much about them. i just need to write and not worry about how """"stupid"""" i think they sound.

"at this point i am very unsure of what exactly to do or where my direction for the future is. my paranoia that i developed from living in ny has certainly overcome my life as everyday is almost a struggle at times to go on because i so easily find something to mess it up. i feel as if everything is always ready to go wrong, so i guess i need a more optimistic view of my life so i don't have to have negative beliefs everyday that ruin a perfect day.  i guess i am also questioning whether i belong in austin or if i should return to nyc and transfer to nyu business school. i will need a 4. 0 both semesters which will be close to impossible for myself in order to stay here. in addition i also wonder if i belong here and if i can fit in with everyone else. they are all nice to me but i just wonder if i can fit in and if they are all being fake to me behind my back, not that i don't already have to deal with that in ny. if it were not for people i could trust like reid or jason or a very few others than i don't think i could make it here. i am very surprised to find how certain people have just drifted away and its like i make an effort and they don't even care about it. i just feel that sometimes things are not any better here than in ny and if it came down to the two i would probably just go back to nyc.   nyc has a very special importance to me. i feel in a weird way that i can fit in there and it is my real home. to have the opportunity to live there for college and party all the time is really exciting, although i wonder if it would be the right choice to go back east since i was so miserable there. danielle is the only person who i can count on and maybe even nicole if i was not so pissed at her for going out with mike, but then again maybe that is my fault. if i wasn't so flirty and actually expressed my feelings than maybe it could have worked a lot better, but then again i always find someway to screw things up as usual which always haunts me at every task or thing now because i go in with such a negative attitude all the time. hopefully i can have another positive year like last time and it will help me be more confident. in the mean time i really need to focus on new goals and establish myself more positively:       1. get a 4. 0 average so i have the opportunity to stay if i want to but keep all transfers in mind especially nyu or something in the boston area in case i feel the need to leave.    2. keep working out and getting big - competition is tough and i have to compete with you know who so i feel as if i must keep on going and hopefully it will work and i will look decent for once in my life - i also need to stay healthy and i need, i want a 6 pack by years end if it kills me      3. work on being social despite my physical problems and hopefully i will win out with whatever way it goes      4. help your community out and help others - remember you have been bad and need to fulfill certain things because the lord put me here for a reason and i want to be helpful and give happiness to others since i am not happy at least     remember to keep it real and tight  . can't nobody hold me down!!!!  i can't stop! i won't stop! i don't even know how to stop!   ) ",1
"     just as i moved to this page my roomate came into our apartment and it appears that he has brought some food back from the grocery store. that is always a good thing. now i'm thinking about how i can possibilly type my thoughts for this amount of time with out taking a break for some snacks and whatnot. today has felt like the longest day that i can remember and i can't figure out why. when i was in my math class at 11 in the morning i for some reason it felt to me as if it was 5 in the evening. now i am listening to the tv in the background and amthinking about how much i disagree with the news man. what is going to be typed by me in 5 minutes from now is flooding me with curiosity. i hope that this week goes by much faster then it is right now. i can't wait until texas plays north carolina this saturday. horns football is one of the top three reasons why i applied to the university of texas and i am very glad that i got in. now i am looking at a picture of the roadrunner from wiley cyotte however you spell it and it makes me think of apples and oragnges. that kind of scares me that random things like that just kind of pop up into my head, but oh well. now i am wishing that i had started some music to play as a was writing this because i am almost always interested in listening to music. yes my roomate is talking to me and he didnt know that i was home this entire time what a silly bastard. now i am listening to whiteny houston who is a supposed crack head butthat doesn't really bother me because she can sing ok. i wonder how many times she does crack cocaine a day or use too. sometimes i wonder what it feels like to be high on coke but i have never tried it. the reasons i haven't done coke is probably because most people i know that do coke are lost causes. my roomate thinks i'm an alcoholic because he heard me say i was drinking punch and i am but he thought it was trashcan punch which means his mind was on alcohol so maybe he is the alcoholic. i am not excited about having to go to three classes today because i am so very tired that i could easily take a nap and enjoy it a 100 times more. i have about 4. 25 minutes left, that makes me think about how much faster this writing assignment has gone thean i thought it would. what my life will be like 8 months from now is a random thought that just entered my mind. i wonder if i will still have my girlfriend, and i hope i do and i wonder if i will be less depressed than i am right now because at the moment i am at a time where very little makes me happy and i really didn't have that problem at all over the summer unless i was thinking about school again. i don't know exactly why but school changes my state of mind dramatically and quickly. i know i should be thankful to even go to school but how can i help the feelings that i have. now there are three two oh times up.

"i figured that i would put this assignment off a little more---or at least until my thoughts were more collected, but i now realize that they're am as collected now as they're ever be. i think about all that i have to do, assignments in school mostly, but i am also busy thinking about a certain person all the time. i suppose i'm going through sensory overload right now. my brain is working at a million miles an hour to keep up with the information that is being put in as fast as possible. then there's that person i mentioned. i am confused about a certain guy that i really like. sounds so tyipical, right? i will have to put those thoughts aside until school is over for the day. i am pretty unhappy with a lot of people that i have met at u. t. they are so interested in having a good time, all the time. drinking and sex outside of marriage, namely. i ate lunch with an old friend that i haven't seen in a long time, and all he talked about was partying, and the like. i don't drink, because of the law (i'm 18), and i don't believe that anyone should get drunk because that's what the bible says. life seems so messed up. i'm not depressed about it, but i am bothered by what i see in the world. i feel a sense of hopelessnes about me, and i know where it is coming from. it started with the fall of man in the garden of eden. god has given man over to his wicked desires, and this means that unless god sends revival, things will continue to get worse. also, i have been reading about the clinton administration in a book entitled unlimited acess, and i think, """"if this is what our president is getting away with who can we trust?!"""" of course, i don't put my faith in things which are seen, but things which are not seen. god is in complete control, and no matter how bad things seem, he will take care of his people. some day, all of this--including the computer that i'm typing on---will burn up. god will come back to gather his elect and the those who are not will burn in the lake of fire forever. this is such a scary thought, but when you think about it it makes perfect sense. god's gift of salvation was totally voluntary on his part. he doesn't have to save anyone. we all deserve damnation because of our sin. we sinned in adam. but in god's incredible mercy and love he sent christ as a propitiaton for our sins that we might not perish but have everlasting life. oh, that i might be found among those names written in the lamb's book of life! i'm a terrible sinner just like everyone else. i struggle with the same problems that everyone does. but i keep coming back to the cross and pleading the blood of jesus. i have no inate merit. my righteousness are as filthy rags. it is insane to think that one can somehow work their way into heaven. the bible says """"not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he has saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renewing of the holy ghost. """" jesus is our only way to the father. not our pitiful attempts to earn our salvation. jesus said, """"i am the way the truth and the life. no man comes to the father except through me. """" you have to come to god (it is clearly taught in the bible), but you can't unless god makes you come(also a clear teaching. """"no man comes to me except the father drag him. """") that leaves you in a particularly strange situation. you have to come, but you can't. i pray about that one a lot. well, those really are the things i think about. i'm a christian, and i live in constant awareness of my creator.

"     ok. i don't know waht to type right now. im listening to alanis morissette right now and the song is about whether she is good enough for anything. sometimes i feel kind of like this; like im not good enough to do anything. now im stumped again as to waht to write. i talked to my best friend kelly yesterday and she is back home now. she went to taiwan for the summer to do an internship. then she went to california to ride a bus back to round rock. but she kept missing the bus back so she ended up staying in california. im really excited that she came back. i havent seen her in like four months and i didnt get to see her off when she left. i was really sad. sometimes i miss having a best friend here. kelly is my best friend in all but she has her schedule and family problems and a lot of times i just miss having a best friend to do everythign with. haley, one of my other friends used to do a lot with me. . almost everything. but this summer she got a job and her dad got a raise so now that she has more money, it seems like she is too good for me. i don't like people like that. there is someone at our room door. haley and i were suppost to go to breakfast one morning and had planned it all out. but then the morning of the event, she had one of her other friends, jennifer, call me and tell me haley couldnt make it because of a doctors appoinment. i was like, why can't haley call me herself. then she tries to play it all off. i don't really have anything to say to her now. i havent seen her on campus since classes started and weve only talked online about two or three times. thats not much compared to how much we used to talk. twenty minutes is a long time to continuously type. i guess its not too bad for people who type slow but for those who type kind of fast, this just makes for a lot of nonsense talking' typing. ok. this semester im taking karate' tae kwon doe. its really fun but a lot of work. i signed up for the class because i thought it wouldnt require too much work - aside from the work out - but actually this class has books and i have a three to five page paper due in it. its the only class i have a paper due in this semester. how odd is that?. oh well, it should be fun either way. this alanis morissette music is some really angry music.

"at this moment i am worried about completing this assignment. the main cause of my concern is that i am using a friend's computer. i do not own a computer and therefore it is very difficult to have access to class notes and homework assignments. i have never really dealt much with computers, so i am not very familiar with this type of technology. i have tried various times to seek help in a public librar, but i was unaware that a long process of aquiring an account and finding a payment plan (if i want to print) was required. this is especially hard for me because many of my classes offer class information on the web. now proceeding to my next concern, tomorrow i have a major french exam. after finishing this assignment i must hurry to my apartment and eat lunch, then return to school. i have no idea what i will eat for lunch, but i must eat at home. last weekend my parents came down from lufkin to visit me. they swore that i had lost some pounds and that i must not be eating healthy. my parents worry about my health very much. being from a hispanic background, education is not of importance. my father threatened to take my out of school if i did not start taking care of my health and house duties. my father believes that a woman's future is in the kitchen. he never realy supported me in my college education. in his own words, he didn't think i """"would make it in the real world"""". my mother begged me to stay close to home and attend a community college. i refused because i am very ambitious and much of a dreamer. i wanted to attend a well-known university (ut) and nowhere else. i worked hard for 12 years to get this far. i did it with very few support from my parents . i encouraged myself to achieve everything i have. perhaps it is better this way because my parents let me become independant and able to have my own dreams. they knew that if i achieved all my dreams, it would be because only i worked for it. knowing that you made it almost alone gives a sense of immense satisfaction and self-worth.

"     as of this moment, i am thinking about my boyfriend and if he truly loves me like he says. i don't think it's possible for him to love me when he gets so angry, but oh well. i notice my textbooks which are collecting dust and have these bright stickers on them. i am also noticing a blinking at the bottom of my computer, which is an instant message from my boyfriend. i wonder what he has to say. i have this funny taste in my mouth after eating taco bell food. it isn't too pleasant. my refrigerator is making lots of noise. i think it's broken. maybe i should get it fixed. no, i'm too lazy. i'm thinking about my boyfriend again. i think he'd make a good couple with his best friend, but i don't know why i am thinking that because i love him or atleast i think i do. how do i know when i'm in love?  i ask myself this question everyday. i don't think i should be because if i was in love i would know. love is very confusing. my boyfriend makes me really angry sometimes. i haven't had this bad of a temper ever. i think some of his temper rubbed off on me. the refrigerator is making so much noise still. i feel nauseous. i want to join a sorority, but i am not sure which one to join because i have heard bad things about the ones i am interested in. i also want to join a service one, but at the same time i want to join a social one. i think i'm just going to join this service one i heard about today and maybe join the social one next semester or next year. i miss taco bell. i used to work there with my best friend. i wish we were still good friends, but now she's weird. sometimes i feel like she's only friends with me, so she can use me. she tends to do that. i'm worried about her though because she's madly in love, but i don't think the guy she's in love with loves her back. well i know for a fact that he treats her bad, but then my boyfriend treats me bad. the refrigerator stopped making noise. yay!  i'm paranoid about me not being able to spell refrigerator properly. i'm confused about the directions. are we supposed to write until the 20 minutes are over or when we finish?  that is what i ask myself. i'm really sleepy. my eyes feel like they have big, black bags underneath them. i haven't gotten much sleep in a while. people keep staying in my dorm room and i can't kick them out because my roommate, my cousin, wants to chill with them. sometimes i wish i could just tell people how i feel straight up but that never happens. i think it's because of my relationship with my ex-best friend. she used to get mad just because i told her the truth, so i feel like i'm scarred for life and can't ever speak my mind. well this assignment was good. i got to speak my mind and release some stress.

today was a good day i enjoy life. i wish i was at home with my girlfriend. she is so pretty i am in love yet it is not here. i wish that she could be here to join me. frat life is demanding yet it should be a good payoff in the near future i wish i could sleep i am so tired that it is hard to stay awake at times during the day i really enjoy this kind valentine assignment it lets me express my true feelings  and thoughts with no real worries except that if it will arrive when it needs to. 20 minutes is a long time to write continuously but it really is neat to think off all the things that go on in my head. like home and vlentina. that is her name the lovely girl that i left back home when i came to college. i am scared that i will not do as well as i can i hope so i don't want to let me dad down he is very important to me even though he is a bit scary at times. but that is how they are supposed to be right? oh well i hope my dog is doing ok i love her so my thoughts drift now into wanting to be on some other planet that is why i love astronomy. even thought it is kind confusing. but it is fun nonetheless i love to use the internet i think that it is so neat. i do however wish i could find a good use for it. all i ever do is waste time going from place to place not knowing where i am going. kinda like life we seem to wander from place to place and never seem to  truly settle down at least that is the way things seem right now in a few years  however i am sure that my opinion will change. i know that once i can complete college which is my number one goal above all else. then to have fun and party. i hope this week we will have a good party i know we will. we always have the best parties. and there  are always girls there. yet i do wish that valentina could be there. even though  she did start to bother me before i left. now it seems that we have gotten closer at the same time that we are apart. is she the girl for me? i do not know and whish  that i did. it seems that way at times. yet then at other times she just bugs me to death an \d all i can think of is getting away from her. i never want to loose her though. i do really care for her. i am looking forward to seeing here soon on my birthday she will stay with me i hope. but i will probably not see her that much since i am so  busy i guess i will just have to make the time to see her. i hope that she loves me i really do. i miss my parents and my old room. my room i\ here is great and i have  fun with my roommates all of whom are from my home in fort worth. so we get along well not like some of the girls that came here boy they cant stand each other and we have only  been here for 3 weeks. not even a full month. i cant believe i am writing this much i normally cannot write this much when working on a paper but now i can i guess i don't really have to think about what i am writing just write it. i think that it is neat . wow that was a fast 20 minutes. i can't believe that it is over oh well i still have on more assignment to do. ,0
"i completely forgot that i had a discussion group for philosophy today at 12, so i went out last night with the intentions of being able to sleep in all day today, but no. luckily my roommate is in the same class and reminded me, so now i am awake. since i have been here i have never spent the night completely alone in our room. however, this weekend i have to stay in town for some dumb sorority match and retreat, while one of my roommates goes home to houston, one to dallas, and the other is always at her boyfriends. so this weekend i will be sleeping here all alone, which kind of sucks. i used to always stay home alone, for weeks at a time. but it will be weird to stay here alone, since i have been here all of three weeks. right now i am on the phone with the health center people, because i woke up with a swollen eye, which doesn't feel to great, so i am about to go take care of that. it is really annoying, it isn't painful, just a constant pain. another thought on my mind lately has been one of my friends; he is also my date to the ou game in a couple of weeks. about a week ago he depledged from his fraternity cause it wasn't for him, he isn't the normal frat guy. however, the other morning when he came to pick up my id he was wearing the outfit that they have to wear for their pledgeship. when he depledged i had a lot of respect for him because he never does things on his own, and while all his friends were pledges he wasn't. when he said he was back in it worried me. i think it is just because he is bored because none of his friends are ever there, so he is all alone. but we will see how that goes.

"how do we know that everyone is seeing the same color. we all call colors by the same name because we are taught that as children, but do we all see the same thing? when i look at something that is red i know what i am seeing, but i have no idea what someone else is seeing. they could be seeing what i know as the color brown. i am sure that there is some piece of scientific equipment that could prove this theory wrong, but it is still an interesting concept to me. seeing something through someone else's eyes is impossible. i have no idea how others see the world. if the color theory were right seeing something through someone else's eyes would give an entirely new aspect of things. red trees, orange apples, the texas flag would be completely different. it is easy to say, no that's a stupid idea, but if you really think about it it is fascinating. people always use the argument that we call colors by the same name. """"what color is that? well, its brown. well i see brown too so your theory is wrong. not so fast. when we were learning the color names as children we all learned the same names. when someone held up a card and said, red, that is the name that you gave that color in your mind. there is no proof that everyone saw the same color. i do not think that this is actually the way that things happened, but it is interesting nonetheless. i would like to know how this theory could be proven wrong. just like i would like to know how they can prove that certain animals are colorblind. they cannot see through that animal's eyes, how do they know what it sees. some animals certainly are colorblind, like the deer. you can wear bright orange when you hunt deer and they do not notice, so they are obviously colorblind. who is the first person that figured that out? they were either really stupid or really smart. i would never think about wearing bright orange to hunt an animal. i'm sure that's not the only test there is to see if an animal is colorblind. there has to be a scientific way to prove it. my 20 minutes is just about up and i have run out of things to say. this is kind of a weird assignment. it will be interesting to see what kind of application this has. i actually enjoyed writing this paper. it is a lot easier to write when there are no set guidelines.

"well my leg kind of hurts. last night while caitlin was out with jonathan, i spilled my ver hot tea on my leg. it hurt like hell. when she came back i was laying on my bed with a frozen dinner meal on my leg. the burn is on my right upper thigh. it really hurt when i took a shower last night to. today it doesn't hurt as much, but it has this really huge blister on it. i don't know if i should pop the blister, or what, so emailed my mom. she works nearby off of windsor. i wonder if she misses me as much as miss her. ? i guess i'm quite a home body, because i live only 20 minutes. away yet i miss everything around my house. i especially miss stephen. he's this guy i've had a crush on for like forever. when i was a sophomore at westwood, he was a junior, and we ended up in the same physics class, anyway he was on the soccer team then and i thought he was cute. i need to pluck my eyebrows, and these desk chairs here at jester suck. i can't even sit cross legged. rruugh. this place is beginning to smell too. i don't know why, but it is like you can't shake it, its everywhere. back to stephen. we work together. have for the past two summers. it's kind of funny because i don't even remember really thinking about him until the end of the summer, but this summer. we were friends from the start. i wanted more, but he never acted on it, it's just as well though considering i have a boyfriend and all. well i don't know if i love stephen, but i sure as hell miss him terribly. i almost cried the first day here. i missed him and everything so much. i gave him my email address, but i suppose he has better things to do than to talk to me. maybe he doesn't have a computer!? wishful thinking. oh well, i get to see him at thanksgiving that's only say 4-5 months away. sucks. he isn't even that cute, and he can be such a pain in the butt too. well, i'm going home this weekend because i have to go to the company picnic. i should leave on friday, but, i don't know what i was going to say andy just i'm'd me. oh yeah, i want to go home for a bit, but i don't know if i'll miss a bunch of things happening here. i'd ask what do you think, but you can't answer me. alan. he's my boyfriend, we've been together for about eight months now. i love him i truly do, but sometimes he is not very exciting like i know him to well or something. that is probably why i am attracted to stephen. he's new, parties has goofy friends. i wanted to kiss him goodbye, but that would be wrong plus, he probably doesn't even think of me that way then i would just be embarrassed. i don't know what to do about him, but i should seriously think of something soon , i've been saying this all summer. but really it is beginning to effect my relationship with alan. the electricians are driving me crazy with their drills. they woke me up the first day i was here, and they've been at it ever since. i tried to take a nap today but couldn't because they are too noisy. alan should drop by soon. i hope at least because i have a feeling i'm going to get bored in this place soon. caitlin is laying on her bed doing her homework i think. i can't believe i'm in college. i don't feel old enough. i think i can handle it though. i don't wont to gain the freshman 15 though. stephen did. i want to look good, great when all the people come back from college for labor day or thanksgiving i guess i should go to the gym. i need to sign up for some class but need money in my bank account to do it. i also need to sign up for apo's a  service frat. i hope they pick me i'd be crushed if they didn't. especially if caitlin got in and i didn't. she is in so many clubs and organizations. i think i should got to some things. i should probably sign up soon.

"working out is stressful. especially if all i do is arms. man i am tired. i wish i could have a protein shake or supplement right now to be able to maximize my workout. i need to go to the bathroom but i can't since i have to right this. i'm glad that i finished the reading assignment over the weekend. oh my arms are so heavy! i like working out but sometimes it takes a toll. my biceps are bulging and pulsing. man i wish i could play a game right now. and now i have gone blank a little. its tough to do this. to think about what one is thinking. i need to move my mouse. there we go. now i need an arm pad or an extension to my desk. man i wish i could rationally think sometimes. or maybe i do. i really need to extend this desk. now i'm reaching way too far out but my arms are so dead that it kind of feels good. wow, now i'm getting thirsty, but its probably because i just got done working out. it says it is 76 degrees outside. let me actually check. it is. a shake would taste good right about now. jester 2nd floor was good today, but not like i had expected it. a lot cheaper though. its weird how they charge more if you use a different form of payment than dine in dollars. i've always wondered why lunch is cheaper than dinner. i usually eat as much or sometimes more at lunch than dinner. so i wonder why most restaurants charge more for dinner. it probably is the belief that people eat more at dinner, or maybe they are trying to pull in crowds at lunchtime because they are not as busy then. who knows and honestly who cares. the room next door to us has a very squeaky door. it slams hard. ouch my deltoid. i am hungry, or maybe thirsty. i really can't decide right now. ouch! wow 11 more minutes. this has kind of gone by fast. i thought it would take forever but it is an okay assignment. and i'm so glad i did my readings the weekend before. it allowed me to have more fun time for me and time to do this assignment. those 30 seconds went by fast. the people are always going in and out or maybe that's just what it sounds like to me. up till like even 2 am in the morning i can always hear people outside my window. i wonder why they are up so late outside. usually people up that late are either studying or getting drunk out of their mind. well i'm going to get something to drink right now. i have had the grape flavor yet so i'm going to see what that's like. never mind, my roommate and his friend took the refrigerated one. going over to get more to cool down even showed me more how i was sore, or maybe just tired. now i have a coke though. but i need to fill my food void. some applesauce would be nice. but i do love sour punch straws. mmmmm. they are so good. nah ill have applesauce. there are also some grapes too. green grapes! my favorite. i don't know why but i've never liked red ones or purple. withe they call it. my favorite color was purple because i loved the grape flavor so much. now i've changed my ways because i've learned that purple is a feminine color. now to get some applesauce. i have to have 2 at a time or its not enough. i'm a klutz. i always drop things or trip at the worst times, but then most people don't trip when they want to. i don't know why but i've been wanting to get fatter. or at least gain wait for a long time now, but i need to eat healthy because i have high cholesterol. i always wanted to gain weight because of football, now i just say it because i always have. when buying this applesauce it was most economical and accessible. they are 4oz each. it says that each cup is one fruit serving of an apple, or just one apple. yes! 1 minute! this applesauce is a little watery. i hate when ketchup comes out at first and its has a watery mix to it. that really disgusts me when at first ketchup isn't my favorite thing to eat. but it goes good with french fries!

"what about this school, too many people running from place to place to be of any noticeable . meaning, any noticeable effect. i can't find the word trying to scribe all my thoughts brimming down. it is much easier for me to describe the pictures in my head, the vivid sensations i am accustomed to beholding within my minds own personal theater. i have developed my own way of thinking, so i like to think!, through day dreams and images, which i behold clearly even with my eyes open as if they happened in front of me. i like to write, but not this droning nonsense which may not receive the benefit of human eyes except for its execution and if, if it gets read. i am told it might not be, and it is this insignificance which repels me to the assignment. at least its easy, except for the internet part.  i have generally avoided this dismal institution for my years, i spit upon the """"net"""" when it first gained its genesis, and i spit upon its multi-media, machination which steals the waking lives from people. but what of it, for that matter, they do it to themselves, i can not pity them for that. if they like computers to sunsets let them use paintbrush to engineer their own nature, but i prefer the real thing made of so much chaos and chance that these simple number-crunchers couldn't make anything with that much sensation, that much depth. that is what lacks in these computers, they are vicarious to life. not that i condemn them, they are useful tools, and not that i condemn their junkies or pushers for the fact of the creation, and not that i live my life to its fullest potential as it may sound i condemn the computer junkies for not doing. its just that, i guess, i have found my own niche in the wall of the world, my own peaceful way of doing things that is inhibited by the computer only slightly, in the way that i hate it and most embrace it. i am hypocritical in this matter as well: i own a computer myself, and use it nearly every day. i like to think, probably falsely, that my downfall in the machine is not so complete as those web-surfers who spend 8+ hours browsing the electronic dreams of men. but then, my won mind produces the dreams i live in: whose to say which is worse?   i prefer to see pictures of the world inside my own mind, and i can contrive any number of vicarious situation, locations, persons, emotions, sunsets, anything i want with a near vivid copy of the real things my eyes behold. is this the same as the infernal computer? is this any less debilitating a habit to daydream in ways even more real than my own, insignificant life? i say insignificant, and i mean it, not in a degrading matter or that i don't feel i have made full use of my potential or that i want for a better standard or situation in my own life, but that it is the truth that all humans are insignificant, no matter how important or influential, save in the numbers of our immense crowd.  i'm sure philosophers have pondered the subject as i do right now for a useless computer, but as i have mentioned, i prefer the daydream, i prefer the novel, and i prefer the realistic sunset to a game of doom(not to say that the particular pastime isn't fun, i'm just as guilty as wasting an hour or so, but i haven't followed it up as many have with the endless assortment of clones that rock the computer gaming industry). i am bored with writing this as though i think in words, because normally i do not. normally i prefer to think in sight, in sound, and even smell(though that's a hard one to master, i don't think i shall). so now i think its time to stop this wonderment i have going and describe what i think about when i don't do it in words:   flashing colors, sometimes geometric-shapes, until i can find something to build the energy in mind into. i remember during psych class when i began to waver off(which i am in habit of doing, sometimes at the wrong moment), daydreaming about my kendo class coming up soon. i thought about a stalwart master standing over me as i held out a bamboo sword, poised straight and steady. i though about going over the moves i knew so well, i am quite a fan of kendo and cannot wait to take the actual class. i hope, though, that my daydream will predict some of the success i hope to have, but i still recognize that it was not real, only a contrivance, and i will have to wait for the fact to see. back tot he daydream i enjoy remembering, and have thought about since. i then imagined as though i were past the class, but somehow not in the real world as we know it, but somewhere where the sword still ruled the land. i think now it must have been my own idea of feudal japan, but needlessly i walked around in nothing but a (i forget now what the karate uniforms i have donned so many times are called) but i was wearing one of those, carrying a real sword this time, trudging through muddy roads through a country side constantly lit by an orange, pasty sun.  i can't remember where it went form there, but needless to say much violence, honor, and success followed. that's how my daydreams sometimes run, but sometime they are more erratic. sometime i let my mind go, though i do have extensive control, and watch bizarre unfoldings before me of pictures melting together, sometimes a forgotten memory boiling up from the depths of my mind, but more often a collage of unearthly landscapes. i have done extensive travel in the southwest of our country, sometimes willing, sometimes not, and have amassed a great many memories of the landscapes. enough memories, in fact, to create my own realistically, though vicariously, through my daydream ability. sometimes i imagine titanous walls of huge cliffs, eaten away by a river evidently, but impossibly showing the scores of rain as though it were eroded by that force alone, topped with greenery though the valley below is of rocks and tumbled stones. i like to visualize. i like to visualize so much that on the last vacation i made special note to remember the best landscapes i saw, and discovered in the process that i couldn't remember the scenes if i wore sunglasses. without them, i could remember the sharpness of shiprock, the depth of the grand canyon, the crumbling stones of chaco and mesa verde. but with sunglasses on, i found i could not remember the details, they seemed clouded and sometimes distorted as thought he glass stole away the true definition of the pictures i wanted to remember.  that is the unfortunate part of my visualizing saga, sometime i mar and twist my own memories into fantastic visages only seen in movies, and then find i cannot twist them back. sometimes i remember the waves at galveston quite a bit larger then they really were, the sun at the most vivid sunrise i recall that much brighter and golden, though taken from the special effects house and spliced with my memory. and i wonder which is better? to have the memory unaltered or to have the memory better, improved and refined into something so stunning to remember or think about that i might include it in stories. that's how i write, too. don't think out the story, i see though it were a movie flashing before my eyes, i hear it though a speaker were plugged next to me, i feel it though i were in it myself. sometimes i think about conquering the world, so much to the fact that i have it all planned out. i feel safe writing about here, because it is doubtful anyone will read this carefully or pay attention to it, but i am confident enough of my long-term plans that i would feel bad if someone didn't have the warning. maybe just fancy, but we will se won't we? if not, then i'll die a normal life, or maybe get a few books out and receive some fame, not as much as i'd like the money though. i'm sure i've met the twenty minute interval, but i forgot to check the clock so i'll keep writing a little longer to be sure to satisfy the requirement. so now i will daydream for sure, and write it as i see it, as though it were happening. no, i better not, it would probably appear too much like my writings, but i will go ahead and make-visualize a new landscapes like i did up there(earlier) because i enjoy it so much.     i see a rising pyramid, sitting atop a four-cornered stone terrace that hold the point towards a sky with two suns, one burning bright and vaguely familiar to our own, the other a hazy blue color, lazily sitting near the point. surrounding it is the ruins of a city, not egyptian though, but more reminiscent of the roman culture, with tilted columns and ruble returning to the desert. the sand is a yellow with glitter, like mica flecks imbedded in the sand, which is hot tot he touch  but not ruff, it runs like silk through the hands. my hands? i don't know, i just watch. the valley surrounding is windswept, though, perhaps they must be my hand because it appears quite desolate. the wind whips the sands into speeding wraiths across the amazingly flat area around, somehow no dunes develop, though. i wonder how that could be. i said valley, but i do not see any moutons or hills around. i wonder what prompted me to describe it as such. if i were writing a book, i would have changed it or added in a distant mountain line, but not so here. the sand seems compacted though, to the foot, though a hand can easily dislodge it, though it seems to flow back into place. it reminds me of the black sands of california, more gray then black, but equally as smooth and mica filled. perhaps that's where its glintiness comes from, a mixed memory of tv and actually physical things i've seen. sometimes its is, most times, though, it is merely illusion, merely contrivance, so i will let it go at that,  ",0
"i don't really know how to start this but i guess it really doesn't matter computers are so frustrating. i wish i knew more about them. its 5:25 now so i need to write until hmmmm 5:45. that's not to bad. i wonder what that guy keeps laughing about, it must be some really fun assignment or maybe he's on email with some girl or something. he pretty cute, kind of looks like the guy on  the princess bride. i love that movie , haven't seen it in a while. this assignment is kind of hard because i cant type as fast as i think. oh, this is how this thing works. kind of annoying you cant even see what your writing! how dumb. i wonder what heather is writing i hope my email got to ryan and jeremy. that would stink if it didn't. what time is it anyway?  5:35 10 more minutes. there sure is alot of people here for a friday afternoon. i wonder if i'll be  in here alot doing homework. probably. i'm kind of tired. i hope gosh i'm hungry. i hope that hope is fun tonight. i want to meet some people . i hope david comes i wonder if trey or jason called. i bet trey did for sure. i wish he was more  talkative but he's really nice. i bet heather kind of likes dave. i wonder if  i'm going to be able to get out of this computer without having to have that  weird guy help me again. i felt so dumb. i need to do my research requirement  soon so i don't get behind. there's a lot i need to do. that guy is laughing again. i kind of wish i could just laugh back at him. gosh i'm a really slow typer. i hope i'm doing this right. i wish all my assignments were this easy. i need a floppy disk and oh yeah i need to get those paradigm notes for zoology. i bet leann doesn't remember to bring me hers. oh well. she's really nice. i wonder where that girl is from. she has a funny accent. i think i've written for about 20 minutes  now so i guess i'll quit even though i don't have very much typed out . i'm just slow. besides they didn't say this had   to be a certain length just a 20 min. time frame. i wonder what's for dinner tonight. i think i'll go find out.

"today i have only one thing on my mind. her name is mary. i met her at this party a while back and we kinda hit it off. i never reallly saw her or talked to her, but the other day i saw her and it was on. i am really worried about tonight. i have a date with her tonight. i hope i don't screw it up. i hope that she likes me as much as i like her. i hope that i don't screw things up. well whatever happens happens. this is weird i havent really thought about a gitl this much since christine, i think that i still think about her sometimes. i don't know why i always do, i just do. i thik it might be because i liked her so much. it is funny because i never slept with her. it doesn't matter that much though, i am a fucking liar. i need to stop lying. i don't do it to be mean or anything i just tell little lies and they get big. i need to be honest with everyone. i am who i am i can't please everyone. i think that one of these days i am really going to get myself into some major trouble. wow i can't type as accurately as i would like to type i want to be able to type with no errors but i think that will be immpossible. i feel really guilty about missing class. i have missed to many classes already i know i am better that that i think i will see how long i have been writing now. sometimes i feel really dumb and unattractive. i am going to hook up with marry i like her a lot dammit and for gods sake i am going to hook it up. i mean that i want her to be around for awhile i am not going to be scarred of this one. ever since about my sophmore yeah in high school i have been really scared of relationships, but i am not going to be any more. i know that sometimes i will get hurt, but that is just the game that we play. if i want to win i got to play the game. i do want to win. i will win, if i keep playing i have to remind myself sometimes that the game goes on. it doesn't stop because you are having a bad day. well lu think that i have really kinda lert my mind go off. i am kinda hungry and a ciggerete would also be nice. i can't eat though cause i just ate and that would be dumb. i have been smoking less and now i only smoke lights i think that it is a good thing that i am only smoking lights. a pack of reds would be really good. but i have to smoke lights for a while. i must remeber to only smoke when it is cool. i can't smoke too much tonightbecause i don't want to send the wrong message. i think that my typing is getting a little better. well maybe it isn't i don't know i wonder if anyone will ever read this. i doubt it if they did really read this they would probbably think that it was complete shit. maybe not. who knows i wonder why nobody ever emails me. well i get stupid forwards but they are really dumb must of the time i wonder what the fuck is really going on in the world these days i want to drink a beer or two or three. i want to get laid. i want love, sex and euphoria. i want it all and i want it to be given to me. i don't want to work, i want to float through life. i want things to be easy i want to pursue my hobbies. i want to get paid for listening to records or maybe making them if someone else wants to listen. i think that music has to be hyping yourself. nobody puts out a record to listen to it themselves. they try to make money. well it looks like my time is just about up. bye ",0
"why can i not think of anything to type the moment when i click the start link? this is so weird, i just hungry everytime after i am done showering. why is that? is it because while i am showering my body also takes the food away from my stomach? i wonder why my feet are so smelly even though i have already taken a shower. my roommate seems to be busy all the time and never seem to have any time to chill or hang out with me and some other people. i think that guy in the spe meeting today was pretty cute. hopefully i will be able to meet him sometime. wow, it is getting pretty late right now and i am getting a little bit sleepy. i took the pretesting for the psychology required experiment testing and it was really long! it was so detailed that i was about to give up and continue it some other time and go to sleep instead. man, i really don't know what to do about calculus. i seem to be struggling in all of my math classes and if i still don't get help by next monday, i will be screwed. i feel kind of floaty? is that the word to describe it? my feet are really cold right now, i wonder why. my hands are a little cold too. hmm. i think it's because that the temperature in this room is getting lower and lower. i really want the temperature to go up a little more if not it's going to be freezing in here like my other friends' dorms at jester west. man. i still have 3 more classes tomorrow but good thing that i don't have any classes on friday! yay! i think i am going to return the dark blue flip-flops since it seems to be hard for me to find something that will match with it. if not, i can ask my sister if she wants to buy it from me or not. hopefully she would want it so then i wouldn't have to make a trip back to the mall to return it. i am feeling really tired and sleepy right now. i wish i can go to sleep but i have to get some work done before it will be too late. hopefully i will be able to go back to houston sometime this or next weekend. i really want to see my cute little brother! i miss him a lot! ouch, my right arm is aching now. i think it's because i have been using the computer too much and typing a lot. i think i really do need a break from the computer. where is he? i really want to talk to him but it seems like he is either always away or i talk to him and he never replies. that is really annoying. my contacts feel a kind of weird. i think i should take them out and put on my glasses instead. hmm. i really do wonder why my roommate has to leave that music on forever. is it because it soothes her from all of the pain and stress through out the day? that's probably the reason why. i really do wonder why she wants to be a vegetarian. i think it's quite interesting even though i really don't think i can live without eating any meat in my life. meat is just too good. i wonder why one of my friends today acted kind of strange. i think she probably felt bad for me for not being able to make it in time to eat dinner with me or it's probably because that she wants to find out something that has to do with either me or this other friend of mine. i think that it really annoys me a lot when she acts in this immature way and causes me to not be able to trust her even more. a few of my friends on aim are messaging me and i am trying to reply to them even though i am concentrating on typing this up. she was asking me about whether i will be going to the next football game or not. should i go? but i think that the tickets is going to be rather expensive but going to one wouldn't be that bad since i have never gone to one before. man. it's only been a few days of my first classes in college and i am gradually starting to hate it. why do college math professors just scribble random things on the board? i mean can they at least have a little bit more organization? it makes me so confused on understanding the material and i can't even figure out how to solve the homework problems. i wish i can change my calc professor but i think that is going to be impossible. ouch, both of my arms hurt now, i think i should be getting off the computer really soon. an individual sports package? what is that? for 40 dollars? i really don't know if i should get it because i don't really want to spend all of my money on football tickets. all right, i think my time is almost up and i am so happy i can go to sleep now!

"     i am feeling a little worried right now about my classes and how well i'll do on the tests and other assignments. i'm used to the class settings now but it's still a little strange to me to be in a class with 100 or more students. i wonder how i'll do in my biology and chemistry classes next semester because i've already heard how difficult it is. i'm stressed out with college work due to the daily reading assignments and i have to take notes over the material for my future exams. i wish i was a senior so i can get out of this place and not have to study ever again! i miss home and i wish i could go visit sometime soon. but of course i can't because i have tests and other things coming up. i can't wait until thanksgiving so i can go home and relax with my family and friends. i wish i knew more people here or at least have some close friends. i haven't been able to start a conversation with anyone in my class. it's probably because i'm shy and afraid to go up to a stranger and just casually start a conversation. i really do miss my high school friends and i just wish i was back in high school. it was so much easier and more fun. oh well. . everyone said college is going to be the most fun and memorable part of your life. after attending the tuesday night bible study, i felt really happy and greatful that i got to meet such nice and open-hearted people. the praise was great and i liked the prayer time too. i haven't prayed to god recently and it gave me the opportunity to communicate with him again. but i felt guilty because i don't pray to god like everyone else on a regular basis. it seems as though i only pray to god when i need help or feeling worried and sad. i should continually pray to him from now on because it's important that i establish an existing relationship with him. i'm glad tomorrow is friday! yay!! i only have 1 section tomorrow and then i'm free until monday. hopefully i'll have a fun weekend unlike last week when i just stayed in my dorm and study.

"writing this paper on friday is extremely irritating for me. i know that i was given plenty of time beforehand, but being the procrastinator that i am i waited until the last minute. this annoys me because i usually do this on most of my assignments. i have a feeling of regret that i didn't do it beforehand. it is hard for me to concentrate seeing that after i am done writing this assignment i am going to go back home to visit some of my friends i haven't seen in awhile. this gives me a good feeling. it is almost a feeling of relaxation and anticipation all in one. tonight i am also going to go to a football game in my hometown. thinking about watching a football game gives me a rush. i get flash backs of my quarterback going through the snap count, my heart pounding with anticipation and anxiety as i am about to get the ball, the snap, and a huge burst of adrenaline as i get the ball. thinking back through each step  i can feel the emotion that was accompanied each step, only at a lower level. i am also extremely tired having stayed up way to late last night. this is probably why i am finding trouble concentrating and being consistent with certain ideas. i also feel confused because i really think that this isn't what the professor wanted, but too bad.

"starting out college life was harder than i expected. i thought leaving home and being on my own would be a fun thing, and that nothing would happen in a bad way. i guess i was wrong because it was very difficult to learning to be on my own. now i have no parents to depend on, and i had to learn to be responsible. the first week i didn't really know many people here so it was hard finding something to do. if i had people i knew i would have placed to go to instead of doing nothing. since there was no homework or anything this was the time to have some freedom. i was thinking that once the school year started i would have to concentrate on studying and worry about grades. i think studying is a very important thing in college life. college life is a whole lot different from high school life. one major difference is going to class. i don't know how to write that difference is in words but i know it is different from high school. it's just this feeling i have. i wonder if this feeling counts as a reason to explain the difference of the two. there's one good thing i recognized about being away from home and parents. that is more freedom! there are no parents telling you to come home at a certain time or to clean the house. being away from is good and at the same time bad. being away from home means being away from family. and no family means loneliness because family is family. there is also friends that you can always make and they can be like your family even they can't replace them. friends are always good to have, but it's also important to have good friends. friends that understand you and will be by you in times of need. i guess there are also organizations and clubs that you can join to meet new people and experience new people. since the first time i came here i have met many new friends that i think are very nice. meeting new people is a fun thing; therefore everyone should meet new people. one thing that is worrying me is the freshmen 15. this i heard from people that already experienced college life. freshmen are supposedly to gain 15 pounds their first year because you have the freedom to eat whatever, whenever you want. the scary thing about that is that a person i know said girls are more likely to gain and guys are most likely to lose weight. i thought """"dang~ why the girls!"""" i hope i don't gain 15 pounds and go home hearing people say to me, """"wow~ you gained some weight in college haven't you. """" that is something i never want to hear. ",0
"     today is a dreary day. the clouds and rain almost reflect the strange mood i have now. i think my thoughts have changed today. after thinking about what my mom said. i almost feel guilty. although i'm just supposed to be happy. i don't really know if what i am doing is wrong or if i just think it is because that is what i have always thought. i want to be quiet. silent. reflective because i need some time to think and not be social. i don't want to waste any time but i don't want to look back on my time here and feel that i never had any fun. i think i am doing a good job of planning and not doing too much, but i just want to be balanced. i need to go to that church that kelly went to , but i don't know how to get there and i feel bad that i didn't go today, even though i went to bed at 4. i need to do a better job next week. i really am begining to miss omar and my family. living in austin is fun but i think i am going to get sick of it if i don't take charge of my life now. i want to do things that make a difference and not just flow with the college life. i want to be different and i haven't found exactly what i'm looking for. i still haven't found what i'm searching for. it is really hot in here. i wish i could turn the air down. but katy is asleep. she is so crazy. i guess i like her as a room mate, it could be a lot worse. but i don't think she is at all a good role model and if anything she will bring me down if i am not careful. i really want to go shopping but i don't have time. maybe tomorrow. i want to buy so many things. i have so many ideas but i have no money. whoever said money does not buy happiness. was wrong. i could have so much fun if i had a whole bunch of money. i would go to all the vintage stores in austin and have the cutest clothes and the greatest room and everything. i think then i would be more confident to go out and have fun and meet people which would bring happiness. right?? i wish that i was bulletproof. i wish omar was here. we could have such a wonderful life if he just lived here. we need each other. he can't do anything unless i'm there to encourage him and give him advice and help. and i can't do anything unless he is here to give me inspiration and comfort and something to be joyous about. it would be so great. oh well, i don't think that will happen. last nite was soo crazy. but i am glad i went, just because i need to experience all that i can so i can really know what i stand for and am comfortable with. if i just stay here and do things i know, then i will never be sure if i am really being real, or just what i think is real. i need to try everything so i will  know what i'm not missing. or what i need to get more involved in. i hope heather, athena and i can hang out more and do things because we haven't and they are my best friends. i think it is weird how we are all here, but we never see each other. i can't belive i cut myself on my bed today. that is so retarded. and it really hurts. i think allison is soo sweet. . we are so alive and it is so funny how omar and ramses live the same kind of girls that live in the same house. haha - we live in the same house, and they live in the same house. that is so crazy. i can't belive it. i love radiohead. it is so comforting. at least i don't really have to do chores here like at home. i am definitly free. it is a strange feeling but i really like it. it's like, i can do anything and no one will know if i don't want them to. that is a eerie and almost scary feeling. sometimes, when i consider what tremendous consequences come from little things. i am tempted to think there are no little things.  i hope omar will write me a song sometime. he really needs to. i can't belive we had that whole talk about little things, and i ever cried! and he still hasn't done anything. i wonder if i just stopped calling him and sending him e-mails, if he would even notice. i would think that naturally he would, but then again i can rarely predict him. he would probably not even mention it, not even miss it. that is sad. i really wish he would be different . he has such potential to be a wonderful , prime boyfriend, but i don't think he really tries as hard as he says he does. ahh. ohh well, it will work out. i am glad i have him, because i don't want anyone else,. . no one. i a very happy with him and i know we will be so happy together when we finally figure out what we are going to do. well, this is almost the end. the end of my moments, and feeling. i want some ice cream. . yea i do. i have so much to do today. i love this music. i want to paint. i need to create something beautiful, and be productive. this is actually the beginning. not the end. here i go. this is going to be one great year. i have promises to keep. and miles to go before i sleep.

"my name is rebecca webber. i wonder how many people will start out this writing by stating their name. it seems the logical thing to do since they have just finished typing it and therefore will be thinking about it. i wonder if this assignment is some kind of study that our professor is doing. he did say that he and whoever helps him would not get around to reading these writings for a long time which makes me think that he is compiling some big database to look at find stuff out about people who take a beginning psychology course at the university of texas and what makes them tick. i wonder how many people will write about how they think that this is a dumb assignment. how come my words are appearing on the screen on one huge line instead of returning to the next line?  i would really like to have access to these writings. i bet it will fascinating to see what people will put down. can any of this be used against me in a court of law?   i am having a great deal of trouble making my computer operate correctly. that is why i am writing this assignment in the basement of jester instead of in the comfort of my own room on the 11th floor. i am worried about having to run down that many steps if there is a fire. the thought of burning to death does not scare me as much as the thought of drowning. that is odd since i am an excellent swimmer and even have worked as a lifeguard. the summer i guarded, i had nightmares about drowning. i don't want to think'write about that anymore. i wonder if luke write his article for the texan. i wonder if daniel is mad about the letter i wrote him. relationships are very hard sometimes. i have two hard relationships. one with daniel and one with abby. gabe is hard to relate at times too. i like abby more now that i don't have to live with her. i wish that i could just be normal where daniel is concerned. actually that is the problem: i am normal. i am tired of this. i swam laps today. exercise is very good for self-esteem, not because it makes you look better although it does)it just makes you feel better about yourself. i wonder if there is a hormone released when you work hard at something that makes you feel good about yourself. this seems like such a waste of time. i glad to help professor pennebaker get tenure though.

"excersise really does work. it does release happy chemicals. i feel reasonably energized now. but at the same time, i feel like it already peaked. its wearing off. jealousy is funny. chris and harvey met three girls while i was gone. i feel left out. i have a girlfriend, and i love her more than anything. i miss her. id give anything for one of her hugs now. but perhaps just the fact that they are meeting people and i am not is making me jealous. but. if they had met some guy, i don't think i'd be very jealous. its girls. i like girls. girls make good friends. i seem to have more close female friends than most with girlfriends do. i always thought this was a good thing, but lately, given my reaction to this new college environment im begginning to wonder if it is. im begginning to wonder whether i just want to meet girls, and have the romantic tension that will never amount to anything more. the romantic tension makes me feel good about myself. shouldnt my girlfriend make me feel good about myself? she does. but i always want more. it's impossible to do this assignment without sort of planning it out. i want music now. i still feel jealous. but while writing about it, some of it has subsided. i feel guilty for being so jealous of my close friends. in fact, my best friend. my roommate. i don't know if he considers me his best friend. it would flatter me more than anything to find out  he did. if he ever told me. if i died, i wonder how many people would say their best friend died? i feel like im a best friend to many people. i feel guilty for this, because   best   friend usaually implies an exclusive position. now that i think back, there have been many instances where one of my friends would tell another friend that they were my best friend. i considered the friend they told my best friend. and i felt like i had done something wrong, like made the person who wasnt my best friend feel to close to me. i like close friendships, with anybody. i don't like going to parties. i like hanging out in small groups, or just talking to one person for a long time. i think i have made a lot more close friends this way than people that go to parties. i think a lot of people are jealous of me, because i manage to maintain intimate friendships with so many people. its odd how oblivious i am to this jealousy. im constantly insecure. i've questioned repeatedly how anybody could like me. i never want to meet anybody like me, i could see through them to everything i hate about myself. even as i tell myself now that people will jealous of me, im sure something will happen tonight that will make me forget that. when im jealous of someone, i don't understand how they could be jealous of me. i'm constantly jealous. for my freshman seminar on concepts of sin, we have to pick our own sin to write about. my sin will be envy. the one i can't control. other sins don't give me as much trouble. im a very restrained person. i think restraint and balance are more important than anything else. especially in love. i say that because i remember a word my teacher was talking about that meant to love your spouse too much. she said it used to be a sin, but its not anymore. it began with a j. i wish i could remember it. im sure ill look it up soon. its a word that relates to me a lot, and i bet i'll sound very smart when i use it. people will think im a very educated person who not only understands himself, but also uses big words to describe his self understanding. anyway, i agree that loving your spouse too much is a sin. my spouse type figure and me seem to have a mutual understanding about this. its odd how at times i love everything, and at other times i love nothing. i wonder if the aderall i take affects that. it seems to stimulate my emotions. sometimes when i take it late at night so that i can focus on studying, i start crying from pure emotion. heh, well, obviously not pure. harvey aays its okay to take because it was prescribed to me. i still think id feel better about myself if i wasnt on it. this band makes me feel better when im troubled. its odd, because theyre lyrics are very meaningless to me. but the music has this sleazy, yet upbeat sound that somehow taps into what im feeling. i wonder if they created this sound on purpose. i saw them live in austin, it was a fun show. i remember a drunk man who was extremely happy jumping up and down a lot and yelling right next to me. that was the first time i ever wondered if i should start drinking. i think i've still decided no.

"i am thinking about my roommate who got the wrong book for his japanese class and didn't realize it till he tried to do his homework last night, he had to get up this morning and drive to get the book and try to do the four pages in the book that were assigned for homework before class started. he is crazy, he and i always get into trouble like that. we've known each other since elementary school and have had some great times. one time i remember we were studying for a chemistry test our sophomore year in high school, it was really late so we decided to go to the store and get some jolt cola to help us stay awake. i ended up backing my truck into the ditch in front of the store and we were stuck. we sat there forever trying to get my truck out of the ditch and then finally i called another one of my friends who had a four runner. he took us to wal-mart and we bought a tow strap. we  went back to the ditch and hooked our two cars up together. he then tried to pull my truck out and his tires just spun around and around. so i had to accelerate and my roommate had to push my truck from behind, by the time we got my truck out of the ditch it was like 2 so we were way to tired to study, so we  went to bed and failed the chemistry test. i ended getting a 79. 4 in chemistry and being moved to the academic class because of 1'10 of a point. if it was for  my roommate coming up with the great idea of going to get jolt cola in the middle of the night i might have been able to stay in chemistry honors, but even if that was the case i would much rather have that memory than an extra point on my high school gpa. my roommate and i now live in a two story townhouse that is 1180 square feet. we got a really good deal on it because the week before school started the apartment complex we preleased with called and said that had no apartments left for us even though we preleased 4 months ago. we had to drive to austin and look for  a new place that weekend and while we were here we stopped by the leasing office and talked to the people there, they said that someone cancelled on a townhouse and that since we had to go through all this trouble we could have it for almost the same price we were going to pay for and apartment about 3'4 the size. we got so excited and i am really glad things worked out like they did because i don't think i could live in a small apartment cause i need  a lot of space or i go crazy too much space makes me crazy too but only when there is no one to share it with. but our townhouse is just the right size and its nicely furnished because both of my parents have been  divorced and remarried so there is a lot of furniture that no one uses, so i got some pretty nice stuff. there aren't many decorations in the townhouse but there are lots of dishes and silverware. i took my stepmom's couches which really surprised me because i didn't think that she would let me have them because sometimes she is strange but i guess she can be pretty understanding sometimes. i used to hate her but now i realize that she really does want the best for me and only gets frustrated cause she raised her kids differently than my dad raised me.

"well today i can't believe i got on the wrong bus. i felt like such a nerd, but oh well i guess everyone has to learn somehow and every one makes mistakes. i can't believe how nice it felt outside today as compared to how hot outside it was yesterday. i am so hungry, i really wish they would have broccoli cheese soup for dinner but i know they won't. i guess i will just have a salad again. even though i eat salad almost everyday i still cannot lose the 5 pounds i gained over the summer. its not like anyone can tell but in the back of my mind i just know that i look so much bigger than i used to. when doing the pretesting earlier this week i couldn't believe all the questions they asked about eating. i can't believe that people actually can do that to their bodies. i am thankful that i do not have to worry about my body in that sense. i wonder what my boyfriend is doing right now. he lives in vegas and it is so hard being away from him. i can't believe i have loved him for 5 months. i am so scared that he will stop loving me and all of a sudden realize that he can do so much better and leave me. if i had to see him at tournaments and he had a new girlfriend i don't know what i would do. he means so much to me but no matter how many times he tells me that he loves me and that he misses me i never believe him. he gets mad that i don't trust him but he should blame that on my ex-boyfriend not me. oh well i guess if it is meant to be than it will be. i am listening to the saddest song called butterfly kisses, about a father and daughter. i have missed my dad and dogs the most since i have been gone. my dad is one of my best friends and he always knows exactly what to do. he is the only reason i want to do well in school, just to make him proud is the best feeling in the world. i wish i could tell my dad that i loved him but for some reason we never express those feelings. i know he loves me a lot because he pays for me to go to school and to fly all over the country to do taekwondo, but i wish it would be ok if i could hug him. instead we always bow and shake hands, that's how you do in in taekwondo. he would do anything to make me happy and he even spent 100 dollars to change my flight so at fall nationals i could spend an extra day with my boyfriend. on the other hand, my mom and i do not get along so well all the time. i love her and when i was sick last weekend she came up and brought me soup and took me shopping, but i don't respect her because she can be very rude to people and when she gets mad she can be mentally abusive. it was horrible living with her when i was 13-17, by the time i was 18 i started fighting back and leaving whenever she would yell at me. my biggest fear besides dying is turning into her and yelling at my kids like she yelled at me. i don't know why my dad still loves her and how he can put up with it, it is not normal how she talks to him or me sometimes. she doesn't understand why i don't want her around my friends or my boyfriend but its because i don't want her to turn into that other person and yell at me in front of them because it really is frightening. my friend matt just came over to distract me and prevent me from getting an a on this assignment which seems to have no real purpose, but maybe it will after i finish and turn this in.

"ah, this is frustrating. seems like i have lost the touch. after all, college is nothing like high school. i'm a mess; i can't pick the beat. somehow, i've fallen behind in my life. pretty much i got to do everything on my own, whereas it used to be people telling me what to do and when to do anything. there was always someone, could be the teacher or mom, constantly laying out the path i should take. now, it's all up to me now. no one can really help. it's my life. is this how adulthood feels like? perhaps, that's just simply a childish question, silly. i can't see what's in front of me, just a big blur, a bit gray. once again, i want to stay as a kid. couple of years ago, our english teacher asked us to write a little journal, """"what age would you stay at, if you get to choose?"""" back then, i thought, """"hey, i am going to go through every phase. that's the experience of life; that's the fun. """" now, it doesn't feel so fun. aw, sitting alone in a class of 500 people doesn't seem fun to me. it's funny that i don't have much people to talk to in real life, but there are people online wanting to chat with me, all those high school friends. somehow they managed to stay 24 hours and 7 days online without much difficulty. i talked to one of them last night, just to keep me awake while i tried to figure my calculus homework. he is quite sociable; i suppose. that reminds me my close friend once called me an antisocialist. not that i don't want to interact with people. it's just that they weren't the exact right people i want to share my inner self with. and again, i've only found one person i share almost all my thoughts with. i remember in elementary school, i used to walk home with my best friend. we wouldn't feel awkward or funny even if we didn't talk or make some noise on the way home. it felt secured. but ever since we moved to us, everything changed. no one here holds the same principle i do; i couldn't outpour what i think inside to those people who think my thinking is so odd, and supposedly weird. i still talked to everyone who wanted to chat with me; i just tell them what i really think inside. i made general comments about whatever they said. this close friend who called me an antisocialist actually talked to me on the phone for almost every night for a couple of years. even he called me that. i suppose he never reached inside of me; my best friend thinks i talk too much. funny how both talk to me the equal amount, but they hold the opposite views of me.

"tomorrw i finally get to go home!!! its homecoming and one of my friends running for queen. college is a great exerience so far, but there is a lot of reading, but on the flip side there is also a lot of parties. i've met a lot of fun people. oh my goodness, i get my hair cut this weekend!!!! i am so excited. this is as long as i've had it in a long time. im so glad to get out of my home town. its so small and so judgmental. every one knows every thing about every one in the town. just the other day an article was written to high school extra about how horrible the coaches in my home town were and some slandering was going on and now there are lawyers and police involved. oh well i guess im not involved in that, thank god. this psy class is interesting and thank god for that, because if not i would prob. fail the course. wow ntwenty min is a lot longer than i thought. im running out of things to say, and that is not usually the case. most of the time i can't quit talking and never find it hard to think of another subject to talk about. i don't have a boyfrien and thats because i don't like answering to people and thats what a high school relationship is. my best frien dane, he was almost a boyfriend, we could never decide what we wanted to do and until a week before he left to college and now he plays football there so i realy never get to see him. but we still stay in contact. foolish pride i guess. well that and i was never able to stay commited and i guess that was the real problem. i didnt want to be held down and i know thats what it would have been like so i just avoided it. scared of commitment? a little but who isn't. plus why just have one when you can have many and more. i sound like the typical guy, but i whos to judge.

"she kind of put me in a depressed mood for the passed few days because she started telling me that she often writes her dad in trying to make her feel better, and it does,  it kind of put things into perspective for me because i wouldn't know what i would do in her situation. well now that i am back in austin i try to  work hard  and try to get thing s like this off my mind. not that i necessarily want to  because  that   would be bad. well now the people i am with right now are bothered because i am using their computer and i don't want them to see what i am typing, i usually feel this way with anything i do, i don't like any one seeing or reading g anything that i  write, do, or accomplish   the  time isn't really going by to fast right now . i have so much in my head put can't think about it right now. i am a  strange strange  person. everyone always tells me that because i always hold back my thought and when i want to let them out my mind draws to a blank. it gets me frustrated, good thing that i work out to work off my frustration. the life is tough, that is what my dad always says, and it is. i don't know how he made it here and have 5 kids have successful lives. my parents have done a good job, they really have. but know in trying to give so much more than they had it's hurting them financially and i feel that me going off to college is putting an even bigger debt in their pocket book. but they tell me not to worry about so i tell them not to worry about me, i also tell them  that if anyone is going to go in debt it's going to be me. let me pull out the loan s in my name let me do all that i   will   be able to take care of it in the long run. right now i'm just tired of being a burden i know what i have to do and  i am going to do it. i have done this type of assignment before, i once turned it in as a paper, and my teacher loved it, it was more in the structure of  a poem, it ended being about 20 pages long and my teacher said it was outstanding, and nobody even believed me when i said that i was going to turn in that abstract paper and they didn't believe me when i  told them that the teacher actually liked it. and that is 20 minutes.

"there are so many things on my mind today. i am still trying to get the hang of college life and trying to cope with the new change. everything here at ut is so different. college is different. it is not what i expected it to be or even what i had imagined. do not get me wrong, i love ut, it is just that i am use to the high school ways. you know, the whole part of being spoon fed. here i have to be responsible, be an adult, make my own decisions, and i am just not ready for that quite yet. ut is so huge and diverse. there are so many people and organizations. right now i feel overwhelmed and a little out of place. i guess it is because i am a freshman, but i know that i will get over it soon. i have been missing my family, friends, and boyfriend so much today. you see i have never really been away from home for more than a week, so this is really new to me. it is an experience. one that i know is going to change my life forever. all night i have been thinking of everything and how new all of it is, and it has made me a little scared and nervous. i have even felt a little stressed out about it. and now i have this thought in my head that i won't make it here at ut. but i know that it is just a thought and that all i have to do is adapt to this new change and work my hardest to make it be successful. i have four years here at ut. i plan to make them the best. besides, i have always loved this school. ever since i was a little girl this has been my dream school. and now that i am here i am going to make the best of it. i have the pride. i have the spirit. all i need to do is believe in myself and do my very best. ut is the best and i am very glad that i chose to come here. so in all, i guess the way i am feeling is pretty normal for a freshman. i just need to get the hang of things and everything will be alright. hook 'em horns.

"  i am sitting here in front of the computer trying to write a constant flow  of my thoughts its about 1:30 in the morning the day of the first ut football  game that was successfully won by the horns my roommate is sleeping right now  it seem that he sleeps almost 14 hours a day it makes me mad that for some  reason that it seems to me that he wastes time so much. all he does every day  is go to class, which i guess i should give him credit for that, and when  class is over all he does is sit in front of the computer and download things  or he lays in bed and watches tv or movies all day he is not that social  either he isn't part of a fraternity or any other group or doesn't play any  intramurals. he doesn't study whatsoever i guess i am just worried about  him because i care about him i mean we've been friends since the sixth grade. it seems kind of weird when we were in junior high he was the sociable type  and i was the reclusive type and about since the 10th grade the situation has  taken a 180 degree turn i hope they televise the 49er game that they are  playing against the rams and even though most everyone especially my roommate  thinks that the 49er don't have a prayer i believe that this opportunity will  be a coming out party for jj stokes and the emergence of jim drunkenmiller the  last rookie quarterback to start for the niners was joe montana hopefully a  good sign i am also kind of disappointed that i am not able to join the  professional business fraternities because they hold most of there meetings  when i have my ch301 extension course from 6 to7:30 pm but hey looking at the  positive side i have something extra to look forward to next year it sure is  great to be alive i feel like i am on top of the world everything is working  like clockwork i feel like watching disney movies well it's about 2 o'clock  so i guess that i should go to sleep to rest for the world that lays upon me  tomorrow and remember to smile after all physical motion controls the mental emotion ( - :      ",1
"well i am just sitting in my room on a rainy labor day, all my roommates are either out of town or napping so it's really quiet in here, which is actually really nice considering i hardly ever get alone time to just sit and think about stuff. too bad that i have so much reading today and preparation for the bible study i will be leading for kappa that i have little time to rest i really have trouble relaxing once school starts up because i have so much going on that i feel guilty if i am not always being productive. i know that i need to take time every day just to sit with god and tell him what is going on in my mind. so that's what i want to do with this exercise i am going to type everything i think about but it is going to be in the form of a prayer to god. i hate that i feel like i constantly need to be watching my money, or what i eat, or anything else in my life that gives me a sense of control and like i am making wise decisions, why is it so hard for me to accept my screw ups? i know i human, and that i am sinful and that i can't do anything on my own. so i don't know why i get disappointed in my failures, why should i expect anything else??? i feel pretty guilty about how much time i put into some of my relationships as well, like i wish i was there for lauren f. more and really was keeping up better with how she is doing and holding her accountable. please give me the time and desire to talk to her and pray for her. i also really need your help in not letting the devil get a foothold in my thought life, i need you to make me aware of when i start to count calories (eaten or burnt!) or when i start to keep a constant tab on how much i spend or what people owe me. lord i want to see every blessing in my life as a gift from you and not as something i deserve because i know that i do not!   i also know that i need to take a nap this afternoon if i want to get any work done later so i pray that i would be able to do that as well. i have so much stuff going on that it can really make me lose sight of what's important. you and my family and friends and everyone else in my life. lord i want to see everyone in my life as a divine appointment. i feel really excited about this year but it's discouraging when i can already see myself getting caught up in the unimportant stuff. i really want to crawl into bed right now and get some sleep instead of finishing this assignment, but what can you do!  i hate that i was so irritable with my mom and dad this weekend and really hope that they can fix the problem they're having communicating, i am also so worried about david, mp, and nancy, i just want them to see that all the worldly pleasures they are looking to escape the sadness of a broken home will never fill that void and that they desperately need to know you lord, and understand your love for them. i wish i knew what to expect on this phl test coming up on thursday, but there i go again with wanting to know things before the right timing. i am worried that i am not studying for my classes as dedicatedly as i should be but i know that i am doing the best i can and they shouldn't be consuming my life. i am so glad i got to spend time with ford this weekend and i really hope that he doesn't have a flight delay because of the rain here and in atlanta because i know he has a lot he needs to do when he gets back. but i know he was supposed to be here this weekend and i am so glad that he got to talk to chris last night and really hope that he calls to tell me what they talked about. i feel a little anxious right now about getting all my work done today and for some silly reason i am really upset that the tuna fish i bought and that 7up drink turned out to be busts, because that cost what, maybe $4???? come on louise you are so cheap get over it!!! surprisingly i am not really nervous about bible study tomorrow night but i know that i need to be really giving that to you and i really hope it doesn't all hit me at once tomorrow. i am really hot so i had to go turn on the fan. i wonder when becca and martha are getting back, is it wrong that i kind of like that they aren't around right now? why is it that i like to be alone so much, is it selfishness??? i am kind of worried about kyle maybe liking me, i really don't want him to, because i really love having him as a friend and i really don't know what makes me think that he might want something more but for some reason i've been getting that vibe lately so i really hope that i can act in a way that doesn't lead him on but that is still nice. man that 7up stuff i got is disgusting!!! why do i always try those things. healthy soft drinks?!?! what a joke!!! of course it's going to taste awful. i really hate that i am always feeling like i need to be repaid when i do something for someone i mean seriously! why can't i just give out of love and show like grace like christ did to us??? i am really excited about this psych class though because it'll be cool to see if this is really the direction god wants me to go for my career. i am so glad to have this day off to rest and catch up in studies and for the 12 hours of sleep i got on saturday i really need to get rest because i know i don't get nearly enough, help me allow more time for sleep and rest in my schedule because obviously you didn't make us require so much sleep for nothing! i just wish i would enjoy it i pray that i could have a peace so that i could sleep right now.

"at the present time, i am content to be writing. it's almost time to go to sleep, and this is very relaxing. i am listening to eminem on mtv. i do not like eminem. i hate to cough. i am coughing because of this stupid dorm room and some studid mold that they think is just the paint doing wierd things. i think that my throat is doing better though, the medication is kicking in finally after about 6 days of torturous soreness. i just talked to jonathan, he is the greates guy in the world. but i don't want him to think that i am the only girl in the world for him. i think that it is funny that a lot of girls thought are about boys. i just want to have fun this year, and not have a boyfriend. i think it is important to just meet people and have connections with each person you come in contact, but they don't have to be any thing more than at that moment. its really late, i wish that i wouldn't put things off till the last minute. i have had such a long day, and am ready for bed. my bed feels so good. i love the fact that i am so comfortable in my dorm with my roomates. they are so great, and fun to be with. chaps is my roommate. i think that name is kind of different, but she like it so i just call her that. i love this song by michelle branch. she ironically is talking about saying goodbye to a boyfriend.  that is what i have had to do for the past year. it was incredibly hard. but i hated the way he acted when he left for college my senior year. i felt so guilty for wanting more out of my senior year than having a boyfriend 300 miles away. he wanted more, and i feel so bad. he has some self-confidence issues. i think the fact that i actually was dating him was great for the self - confidence thing. but once we separated, it just hit him so hard. we are really good friends, but i really think he still wants more. someday, i might also, but not now. i love that the zeta's symbol is the strawberry and the queen. it is so exciting. i am so excited about organizing my new member book. i love organizing. it almost gives me some kind of high. to be totally organized, and know where everything is. i need that kind of stability in my life, because i do so much and stretch myself in so many difections. i don't know how i am going to do sororities, get my gpa up to at least a 3. 8, and do two organizations outside of school, (which is required by zeta sorority). but i perform best under pressure, so the more the merrier. i am so excited about texas spirits, that is the organization that i hope to join, as my organization to have to join. jessica is in texas spirits, and i love her. she was the person that made my decision for zeta tau alpha so concrete in my mind. i dreamed that i was a zeta the night before i found out which one picked me. i think it was a sign or something. jessica means so much to me, but she is always too busy with katie johnson. today, she did give me a card with a picture of us in it saying that she is sorry she hasn't been there to hang out with me as much as she wanted to. zeta is going to be so awesome to be a part of. i love the friends that i have made so far. i just really think that the parties that are involved are a little too numbered throughout the week, i mean they want us to get good grades, and be in all these organizations. yet they give us all these mixers to go to to meet people which i love to do, but they are on week nights. oh well, i just am going to have to limit my participation in them. i miss my high school friends. i haven't talk to rosie in ages, and casey didn't even say goodbye before she left. i am going to have to send them an email pretty soon. the sound of the mouse and keyboard are such wierd noises. and so are the sounds that come out of the actual computer. i always have wondered what makes the little clicking noises in the computer. i mean is it gears shifting, or electrons being shot out of some kind of machine. i want to know. that is interesting. and i am glad to be done.

"why am i being forced to submit my consciousness to the ut psychology department? the entire situation is abhorrent. it is wrong that there is no reward for completing this assignment it is not part of the grade, it is only taken away from the grade if one does not do it. the current state of the field called psychology frightens and disgusts me of course, if my writing assignment is one the few that actually gets selected or enough words pop up on the screening, then this will probably unfavorably affect my standing. insulting one's life work is no good, but this is how i feel and know it to be. because i have a dangerous weapon called reason and psychologists can try to convince me that i am mistaken, but i do not doubt myself. the problem with natural selection is that has been warped, mutated almost like a cell becomes cancerous if it is tinkered with enough. we have tinkered with natural selection, tried to control it, and now it is selecting out the strong and protecting the weak. this i know. what to do about it? i don't. these negative things come to mind whenever i am faced with dealing with this psychology class and its insidiousness. it is a perfect example of hundreds of kids who should not be in college, do not want to be in college for the sake of learning  having all of these dangerous misconceptions being dumped into their limp, willing brains. i have noticed how even a gap of two years can make all the difference. maybe it's not even a timerelation thing. again, it is that weak and deathloving portion of society that is being protected from this new, malignant form of """"natural"""" selection. if this sounds disturbing, well it is. i don't appreciated being forced to submit and i emphasize that word, my consciousness to be at the disposal of the ut psychology department. this has nothing to do with my benefit. i could and do this often on my own time. but i am submitting this to them under the threat of punishment, and for what? i don't exactly know, and that makes it worse. i have few things of value in this world, but i do have my mind and my intellectual property. i do not appreciate being forced against my will to give it up to any random person who obtains a phd. but that should further go to exemplify the way this newly dominant breed works. does this sound radical? very well, it sounds radical. it is radical. just as a """"serious"""" presidential candidate playing with subliminal messages in advertising is radical and frightening, so is this. and the ridiculous thing about all that is bush jr or the experts he has hired to think for him are trying to subliminally affect a group of people that don't even have the power to elect him. a more productive way to sleaze into the white house would be to simply bribe the electoral college. how did we come to this state of affairs? by people refusing to think, i suppose. not being willing to think because of the discomfort involved. these are the people who should be selected out, yet are not. how did this come to be? i don't know. maybe television is performing some sort of mind control we don't even know about, as conspiracy theorist as that sounds. track my thoughts and feelings as they occur. what if i don't think in language? what if i think in images, sounds, smells, etc? how are you to know how i think? stream of consciousness is not writing. it is babbling onward and forward as a three year old would do. if animals could talk or write, stream of consciousness is what they would do. thank god, my time is almost up. i suppose i should say that i've never met a psych major that i liked or respected, since that is what just popped into my head. in submitting this, i suppose i am allowing whoever is analyzing this to do whatever they please, plagiarize, or otherwise. it is no longer my property, i have been forced to give up a part of my mind. so it can be categorized and used as someone's research and study. i will fit into the category of bitter, paranoid lesbian female from small town outside of texas, nonfreshman, english major. i have seen my life summed up by such words before, also by such people as yourselves. i suppose i should save this as the computer and website seems to be messing up right now. no way in hell i want to do this all over again. oh look  time is up. i guess you won't be privy to my thoughts any longer.

"     right now i am doing this psychology ut what will i be doing in the next couple seconds. oop, my roommate just walked in and i have to talk to him and do this stream of consciousness writing at the same time. hard! my room mate said hi and i am having trouble responding to him, it looks like stephanie is impressed with my bass. all right you all have a good one. roommate has left, that is weird. i wonder what misung shin  yeah interesting ats salivate when they win him and stephanie are going to do together, probably nothing much, i can hear my roommate, err my people across the way talking about something they usually play madden 2005 until the wee hours of the morning which doesn't really bother me but i think it might a little, who knows its probably just something to complain about. i want to go out to dinner tonight and was thinking about going with david but i don't have his number so maybe ill call mom and  dad to find out his number oh man that paper reminds me, i got to do the psychology experiment before saturday i don't really understand the experiment system but i think it is explained somewhere in this syllabus well i have been going on for a while now and i still have a ways to go, phooey. i like my psych teacher though, he can somehow make the things we talk about in class not only funny but very interesting. oh man i think i accidentally typed some words in the wrong spot oh well i'll just keep going so yeah my psych teacher is good, and this intro class is very interesting makes you want to learn more about neurology i was thinking about how he really knows his stuff and if i could ever be  a professor who really really knew his stuff. do i work hard enough? i think i do, i been taken it easy this week just chilling in my room but i've been working too. another thing that i can't escape thinking bout right now is girls it the subject on every young mans mind, yet maybe i think about it more than others. i think about whether or not i'm too picky. i haven't ever gone with a girl for longer than like 2 months i really can't stand the thought of a girlfriend, i haven't really met a girl that i'm really interested in even though in these first few weeks i've already had some opportunities but i just straight decided i didn't' want to go with them why? you know it has to do with looks i probably seem really shallow but i just want a chick who looks damn good not just good if i find myself thinking of reasons why i don't like you the fact of the matter is i'm going g to ditch and better sooner than late i've ditched some really cool people and i feel bad about it but then i've been ditched too sometimes i think i have too many friends but the fact of the matter is if you don't want to be somebody's best friend eventually your just not going to hang out anymore so i need courage the courage to approach a girl and ask her out on a date, don't worry about if its going to be a good date just go for it and get rejected damnit that's what i say get rejected and feel that pain because one of these days your going to ask her she's going to say yes and then its just going to work these things don't just fall into your lap out of the blue at the least you have to keep yourself open to other people always meet new people i think i will ask kim and liz if they want to go out sometime now there's two people that look like they got their shit together liz dropped out of sfa last year so what? she has her priorities straight you know everybody has their faults i don't want to be recognized for getting a's in class that's crap i want people to say yeah that guys is a friggin funny cool guy i like being around him, but i only want people that i can get along with to say that how do you tell the ones that like you but you don't like them gto go away it seems harsh you don't want to be an ass and the fact of the matter is you may need them some day but for what??? as long as you've got your friends you are unstoppable you are having fun you are just with your buddies and you wouldn't have it any other way like my family man i just realized how much i love them by being away from them for such an extended period of time i really missed them i didn't think that would happen but it did my sister my dad my mom are really important to me and i love them to death bottom line man i'm hungry after this i'm going to see if i can get a hold of david and singer and maybe well go get something to eat i got to talk to david man that guy is really cool maybe i have the number in my desk somewhere i don't know but maybe ill just be lazy and go out by myself, maybe just maybe ill go out an meet somebody that will play an important role in my life maybe ill have one of the best times of my freshman year who knows what could happen in the 20 minutes after i finish this project who knows?  god knows? don't get me started i could write all the proofs that straight out blast christianity to the nether regions but no i believe in that little piece of spirituality that's in us all call it god jesus whatever its there but it is just there its our spirituality it is us so thanks for reading and ill talk to you later boi.

"i am moving my foot back and forth and i find that to be very reliving for me . i can't believe that the only thing keeping me for getting married is my girlfriend, is that such a big deal am i ready for all that stuff. who is the best person i can talk to that won't ever judge me, i think that it is my girlfriend. i can't believe her,  she is so rude to me when i do something that is not good as far as she is concerned. hard to believe is not it. i don't want to talk about this any more because i am not to worried about it. i have to swim in this thing some day  i use to play football for a&m. i walked on my freshman year and now i don't do anything. i wish i could do something like that now not only reason to stay in shape and but also because i miss it and i want to play again. i type to slow i am very tired of it and i need to go.

"tonight i get to go to a date dash function with my new sorority. some of my friends set me up with a guy that i have never met before. i can't wait to meet him. i hope he is nice and at the same time, good looking!  this week has been good. all my classes are going well, so i feel confident about them and life in general. lunch today was especially good, since i haven't eaten a real meal in a few days. i love college. it's so good to not have to worry about a curfew and letting my parents know exactly where i am going to be, etc. i love my roommate, and we have almost the same schedule, so that works out perfectly. last night, i typed an extrememly long letter to a friend that i hadn't talked to in a few weeks, so my fingers are still kind of tired from typing then. that's ok, though, because i am getting some homework done early, so that i don't have to worry about it later on. that is definitely a good feeling. i am also feeling excited because i saw two guys on campus this morning that i know from high school. ever since the first day of classes, i had been wanted to see someone i knew. it just happens that those two that i saw today were also some of the cutest and most popular guys that i know. lucky me!  this gum that i'm chewing is from a blow pop that i finished a few minutes ago, and it is already losing its flavor. those things never last long at all. i have a problem with one of my classes. see, i swam all throughout junior high and highs school, and i want to continue in college, but every time i want to do something, the class is in the way. i've already changed the time once, but it still causes conflicts. that is very stressful. i don't know if i should change it to an early time because then, i would have to take a shower in between classes, and it might be a pain. but then at least i'd have time to go to my sorority meetings and all the fun parties and stuff. but would i have time to take my regular naps in between my classes like i usually do?  no, i don't think i would. let's see. which is more important?  i guess more things will come up in the evenings than in the mornings, so it might be better to change to that early time. i just don't know. wow, i have like nine minutes left. this isn't such a bad assignment. psychology is actually really fun. i've only been to two classes, but the professor is really funny and definitely keeps my attention, which is hard to do for an hour and a half. i hope the tests aren't too hard, though, because i'm not that great at analyzing and stuff. i took psychology in high school, and it was way different. my teacher bored us to death, and we learned practically nothing. it was the easiest class ever!  i am going home to houston this weekend, which is very exciting because all my friends from different colleges are coming home, too. we are all going to go see clay walker, my favorite country singer. my ex-boyfriend will also be in town. i haven't seen him in over two months. he goes to west point in new york and had to leave in late june. i talk to him every once in awhile, but i miss him so much. we are still great friends, and i can't wait to see him again. we dated for a year and three months, so its strange not to see him at all anymore. this gum is really ready to be thrown away, but i'll wait for my four more minutes to do so. i have one more class today, and that is a study hall calculus. those are never stressful, since the t. a. just helps us with some problems like our homework. he's a nice guy. the first time all we did was say our names and stuff like that, but i'm sure we'll actually accomplish something today. at least i hope so. getting to know people is good, but i really needed some help with a couple of those problems!  well, i guess it has been twenty minutes, so i better go. hope anyone who reads this is having a great time!  :) ",1
"i'm so confused and overwhelmed right now. between school (hard classes, lots of homework and many hours), and sorority stuff (meetings or at least something every single night and weekend), and problems with my boyfrined (we're on the verge of breaking up), i don't have time to do anything fun or relaxing. it seems like i'm always going and i don't have time to stop and breathe, and evertyhing  conflicts with everthing and i'm having to miss so many things for all my differnt things i'm involved in. things wouldn't seem so miserable to me right now if it wernen't for my guy problems, too. i really wanted the whole long distance thing to work out and it seemed like it was, but we are both so busy that neither of us ever have time to go visit the other one and we both hate being so far away and never getting the chance to visit each other bc of our damn busy schedules. i am always so tired and stressed and never get a chance to sit and rest. i have to plan my whole day, down to when i have time ot eat and shower, every morning the second i wake up. even though i'm complaining a lot, i love sorority life, i love ut, i love all the frineds i have made, and all the things that are going on every night and every weekend, it is just so stressful bc i can't do everything at once. i'm not even real sure what i'm supposed to be writing about or anything, but all i can think abot right now is my guy problmes. me and my boyfrined got in a huge fight tonight, so big that i threw my phone and broke it, which i usually never get mad or violent. but we both think that the other one is being so selfish to not be making time for the other one, but we are both in the same boat when it comes to our busy schedules. i don't know what to do, and this is all that is on my mind bc he means the world to me, and i don't know what i would do if we broke up, but i'm just so confused and don't know what to tell him or what i should do about this whole thing. i wish i could just take off from school and everthing and drive away and go see him for the weekend and work things out. i really don't know what else to say, i am rambling now evertying that pops into my mind. i really am having a great time down here asides from my crazy hellish schedule. i miss a lot of my frineds too. and it is so hard to get studying done here at the dorm with all my friends around all the time, with my radio and tv going, my phone ringing off the hook, my computer sitting right here tempting me to get on instant messenger and chat with all my friends. i'm just stressed, that's all there is to it, i hate feelign like this too, bc there is really nothing i can do about it, there is nothing i can get out of that i want to get out of. i am really hoping that things will just slow down and life will get to what i consider normal. that would be awesome. i don't know if that will happen and when it will if it does, but i'm really looking forward to that.

"being at cllege is a new experience for me and i think that it is giving me  a sence of being dependant on myself. i like all the new freedom that i have  gotten, but i also am homesick a lot. i miss my parents and being in my house  in houston. there isn't anyone to make sure that i do everything that i am  supposed to do. i am a person that does not get stressed out a lot, ut now that       i am in college and having to take care of everything on my own, i am  getting worried and that is gettting me scared. i have a lot of thing s that i  need to get accomplished and don't have time for it. it makes me very  frustrated and annoyed at the same time. i feel like i should be a lot more  organized and up to date with everything. i am a very organized person, even a  """"neat feak,"""" and that is why it's driving me crazy when i am behind. i think  that if i work hard, then i will do alright.       last weekend, i went home and visited my friends and family and it felt so  good to be home. i was able to go driving around and i knew where everything   was, and that feeling of being in control was great. think that i just need  time to settle into ut, and then i will be in more control. austin is never  going to be """"home"""" for me, but it will be a place that i can come to enjoy. i  don't think that any city can compare to houston because that is where i grew up  and that's also where i have all of my family and friends.       sometimes i think about how life would be like if i was adopted or even if  one or both of my parents were dead. i look back and don't think that i could  manage. my parents play a very important role in my life and i don't think that  i would be the same person that i am without them. i know a lot of people that  have parents that have passed away and they have really gone through some rough  times and they are doing well now, and i give them so much strenght and poer for  being able to do that. if my mother would pass on, i think that i would really  go into a state of depression, and would go trough a transformation, in that i  would become very quiet when usually i am very outgoing and lively. many things  don't affect me unless they are very close and dear to my heart. i usually  don't cry in movies, and i don't care to become very emotional all the time. i  have too much pride to cry infront of people other than my family. no matter  how depressing the news, i am unable to show my emotions. that is something  that i think that i get from my parents, specifically my mother. i think that i  have gotten a lot of my qualities from my mother and most of my physical  qualities from my father. i think that i am able to be the person that i am  because of my parents. they helped shape me into the person that i am.       there are friends that i have been close to in high school, and ever since  i have come to ut, i have not been as close to. i don't know the reason for the  change, other than the fact that our schedules are conflicting and that we have  not tried as hard to keep in touch. i have heard that things like this happen  and that you make all of your really good friends in college. i know what  people say, but i have a really good friend at trinity and me and her have keep  in touch really well. i think that she is an exception to the """"rule.

"its hard to think what comes in your head naturally when you're told to do it. i wonder what my pledge brothers are doing now. i was having fun. i should've gone to these classes more so i would know this was coming up. i guess skipping class for the band makes it worth it though. when is chris going to move up here? i hope they don't make me depledge for the band, that's just dumb. its all michael's fault anyway. he's just pissed that he didn't pledge and now he's left out of everything. well that's not my fault. i hope catherine doesn't think i'm weird. i just figured i could ask her to the party cause most girls want dates. maybe she did want to go but who knows now? ill ask cat pat. whatever. i've fallen in love like 30 times a day since i moved in here anyway. i want to play my guitar. college is cool except classes get in the way. if i could just play my guitar all day, id be a happy man. besides, the only way we can consider ourselves growing in intelligence and intellect is when we realize more and more how ignorant we are. animals may not speak to each other in words, but they also don't kill each other for reasons other than food and defense. we do. that's a good thought. i need to put that into a song. we only get smarter when we realize how ignorant we truly are. maybe this paper will be worth a damn. ah well, i wonder if people are going to know i write all the lyrics to our songs? i bet they wont since michael sings them all. its like the motley crue deal where no one knew that six wrote the words and vince just sang em. he sucks at singing anyway. i hope he doesn't read this one, i should watch my language. whatever. man is bekker going to call or what? she gets all pissy that i haven't talked to her and now the first chance i get i've called and she hasn't called back. that's probably what she wants though, me to start thinking about her. oh well, she's hot. i which there was a way to write out these blank spots in my train of thought where i don't even know what i'm thinking about. i bet i do but the memory isn't there so i don't know by the time i'm about to type it. i guess i just put those blank spots into words though. good job matt. wow, only half way done. i wonder how my high school football team is doing. i can't believe i made it through that. adolf as my coach for three years?! that's amazing. i'm proud of myself, no one expected someone like me to stick with it. now all the older frat guys respect me cause i played against half of em and i never stayed down. hell, one of them walked on at ut. i wonder if i'm going to be spending the rest of my life challenging myself or if ill one day be secure in how i am. i wonder if i need to be using punctuation and capital letters. i bet his computer thingy is going to mark my paper as something to check cause it wont make sense with the punctuation and capital letters missing. whatever, hell read it and think i think i'm cool since i rambled on for 10 minutes about high school football. i enjoyed that class last time, i need to start going to class every day. damn matt, you're going to screw up college and you're smart as hell. this is why you're stuck home tonight with a twenty minute paper and an astronomy test both tomorrow. i bet i have something in spanish but forgot. i've been to that class every time though. if every class took roll, i don't think id survive. weird that i never once skipped a class in high school. no detentions, aep, nothing. i was good as hell. i guess my mom working there influenced me at first and then it was just a habit once i realized i owned my mom so i never had any desire to skip. i guess now that the band has a chance to do something good cause were not stuck in houston anymore i can skip. i see it more like this band is like another person having an internship at a law firm. they want to be a lawyer but their parents made them major in cooking or something. would they skip the internship for cooking? hell no, neither would i. i'm going to skip cooking. or class in general. i'm going to be happy dammit and i'm not happy unless i'm playing in the band. just hope my parents don't find out. maybe if i do well this semester then they wont watch as much next so i can put even more focus on music. who buys a ball of rubber bands? why is this ball here? why am i not on my own computer? why can't they just make it and ship it? this sucks man, johns going to start getting annoyed that i'm on so much. oh well, at least he's not here now. i can't believe he knocked my guitar over this morning. i can't believe i slept through my alarm this morning. i want to sleep. whatever i'm done with this. i'm going to study astronomy now. yet another class that's been avoided.

"i've done this type of assignment before. sophomore year of high school for mrs. hollingsworth. all i talked about was diet coke, because she had one on her desk. today i went to class and i though i would be late to spanish because i was coming straight from sociology class. i didn't even lock my bike up right, someone could've pulled the wheel off and taken my frame. i woulda been walking back to my dorm with a wheel, a u-lock, and a frown on my face. it was hard to focus when all i'm thinking about during a class is how stupid i was to lock my bike up wrong. it didn't get stolen so that was good i just rode it back and i was fine. i hate riding along busy streets i never know if i should be on the sidewalk or on the street, the crosswalk or the lanes. it's so crazy, usually i just go back and forth and try not to get run over. this morning i got up and ate yogurt too quickly i felt kinda crazy in the stomach for my first classes. it went away once i was able to drink some water and let time pass. for a while i was wondering whether there was a reason why that yogurt was the cheapest. i always try to find the cheapest stuff at the grocery store. yesterday was the first day that i used a push basket at the supermarket. i usually just walk around holding all the goods in my hands but there was too much. it was kind of a weird feeling because it was like i was growing up or something. i have to start clipping coupons and writing checks and things like that, yesterday when i was pushing the cart, that was the icing on the cake. next thing i know i'll be getting married and crap like that. i guess all that stuff isn't so bad, but it seems like i got a grasp for the real world so quickly, but i'm not even in it yet, whatever it even is. i always think about the book babbit, by sinclair lewis. he is painted in the book as some horrible guy who sells out his own beliefs and everything else so he can gain prestige and what not in his community. it's really hard for me becuase he is very human. there are aspects of george babbit in all of us, and drives me crazy. i have a constant struggle within myself to decide whether or not you should hold strong to minor beliefs and principles and be held back in the system, or if you should try and play the system and get what you can out of it. if you play the system though it's kind of like selling out, you just become an opportunist. but it seems like you have to compromise your beliefs to certain degree. it seems like every decision i make, i don't know if i should do things to appease people and get ahead, or to hold fast to things. i'm not talking about the biggies though, just the small things. i would be afraid though that the more i ignore the small things, i might gradually start into the big things. i don't want to become like kurtz, he had no restraint and he just got more and more into a state of immorality and all this other stuff. i'd like to think that i had restraint, but i have no clue if i do or not. i can demonstrate restraint in small cases, but kurtz could too when he was in the confines of society. i don't know if i would revert like he did, i hope not, but no one can say unless they cross the same bridges that he did. heart of darkness is definitely my favorite book, it is really thought provoking and there are so many levels that you can interpret at. i read it for school last year and loved it, i read it about five3 times after that too because it's so good. i really like joseph conrad, but i usually odn't talk to too many people about him unless i'm drinking and my tongue gets loosened. most people talk about sex and things like that when they drink. i always talk about heart of darkness, william shakespeare, and lord byron. i don't really drink that much, but it's happened before and those were my favorite discussion topics. once i tried to tell this guy about freud and the id, ego, and superego. all the sober people told me that i was 100% right in all my statements, but the drunk people just didn't understand. i don't know what to write right now, i have a lot going on right now. most of my classes seem like they're going to be pretty easy, but i never know.

"well here i am in the undergraduate library writing my stream of consciousness     paper. i still haven't really figured out yet what i will write about, but i suppose that     this type of paper isn't really supposed to have a meaning. that's good i guess,     right. sure. it's cold in the computer lab here. it's always cold in this lab. and it's     always cold in the library. in most places throughout the university, in fact, it is     cold. it is especially cold in the student union. i mean -- ridiculously cold. it must     be about 70 degrees in there. there is one place, however, that i have found is     not cold - it is hot. my calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really     warm. and it doesn't really help that it is still like 90 degrees outside. one thing i     have noticed though, is that it is getting a little cooler outside. this is very good     news. hopefully it will continue to get cooler. so looking at the timer at the top of     this page, i am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long     time, especially when you consider the fact that i really have no topic, nor have i     even begun to write on a topic. it's just meaningless facts from my mind. i'm sure     that this has some kind of meaning - this writing i mean. there must be some     point for this. hopefully at least. so far my classes have been pretty good. i don't     have a huge workload yet. i assume that it will pick up eventually. especially next     semester. from laurel's experience, i have a feeling that next semester will be     quite a bit tougher than this one. actually, i am quite certain that it will be rough. i     will be taking differential equations -- which scheffer said was hard --  and     physics, which i know will be hard. oh well, i can handle it. i am enjoying school,     though. it is quite a bit different than anything else i have experienced this far in     my life. all the freedom and extra time. i just like the atmosphere that is college. it's fun and different. well only five minutes have gone by so far. i'm still a little     hungry. i should have had more lunch. oh well. i only have one more class, and     it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour. that's not too bad. i am writing on a     macintosh computer right now. i didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so i took it. they aren't too bad i suppose. it would take a little getting     used to. and the keys are quite a bit more sticky than i am used to. and the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. but the thing that i find most     interesting is the fact that microsoft internet explorer is on an imac. i had always     wondered if microsoft put out programs on apple's. quite interesting indeed. now     i'm pushing the 9 minute mark. looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff i have     written in the last nine minutes. all pretty meaningless though. i think i may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. you know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. quite annoying i must say. during swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. especially with coach hutch. man he was a killer. i think that was the hardest year that i ever had with     swimming. funny thing is -- i didn't get a whole lot faster. i got faster with coach     wilson -- as much as i hate to say it. ok i give -- i looked at the clock. now i only     have nine minutes left to write. that's promising i guess. i wonder how the swim     team is doing now. with the girls and the guys separated and all. i wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with kyle again. the guy     behind me has more i'm's up than i have ever seen. he seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. the whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. crazy. this whole macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. i can't stand this keyboard. it is so sticky!  every other word, i have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. i also keep going back because i keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such. i am used to a program fixing it all for     me. oh well i suppose it's good for me. but this sticky keyboard is not. geez!  if     you can't tell, it is starting to bother me. and they crazy imer is still typing away to     like 50 of his closest friends. it's funny what you notice people do when you just sit     back and watch for a minute. (6 minutes left)  one good thing i will say is that     macintosh's do look pretty cool. i like the whole clear theme. i also like the     widescreen. it's pretty cool, and is very clear and bright. i think the clock on the     computer is slow. after 20 real"""" seconds - by my watch - the clock lost 5 seconds. so for every """"real"""" minute, 75 seconds go by. so in a 20 minute writing sample, i     must actually write for about 25 minutes. see i thought this was an abnormally      long time to write. i thought that my watch said 12:01 when i started, and now it is     12:37 and i still have 2 minutes to write. maybe this thing loses even more time     than five seconds for every twenty seconds. that's crazy. i have a one o'clock     class. i hope that my """"2"""" minutes doesn't last too much longer. well in conclusion,     this writing experience has been. well. real - to say  the least. i have to say that     i have never written a stream of consciousness paper before, so this was a first. i     don't know that i like it that much either. i have noticed that when i type on the     computer that the seconds don't even move at all. so i have been writing for a     loooong time. ok, my time is up. bye.

jamie signed my yearbook a funny way what a fun guy man i forgot that he's not around i wonder how belmont is. probably fun i bet he has some really weird choir friends but i bet he'll make it big maybe in the music business doing something. maybe producing but i seriously doubt that he is going to perform unless he spins records --turntables are expensive--two turntable and a microphone i wish i saw beck at edgefest and i wish i went to the first edgefest i want to see the nixons man sarah is a jerk i hate how she acts like a little kid and she thinks she's all hot and stufff how arrogant i bet she feels lonely back at home but maybe she'll change i don't think everyone i know will change because of college even though elliot thinks so except maybe mark cause i can see him getting a big head cause of his car but i can't believe the sex thing how could he even think about having sex he must be pretty immmature i want to play basketball with the gang when i get back i wonder if i'll see jason probably not since michelle isn't going to dallas i don't think. in need to get kheang's phone number my time still isn't' up have to keep writing i can't believe i'm writing so much i bet if i was a slow typer then this would look like 20 minutes i bet i could stop right now and my professor wouldn't even know that i didn't type for the whole time but i kindof just told him just now so i guess i 'll keep going but i could easily just erase it can't believe no one showed up for my ba 101 class that pisses me off that no one showed up business people seem to only be into material things like that guy with the beard from new york or miama what a boring life i would hate to work my whole life for some chump company like motorola what a waste who cares about cellular phones i want to make a differenece and work for a company that is making a positive effort to improve the world like a medical company but what about all this hmo crap i don't understand it my mom is so good at that stuff i wonder what well do when i get back to dallas i hope i'm allowed to stay out late and see elliot venkat and emily i guess even though she's not really my friedn i keep making typing errors and my back hurts i need some dr. pepper i wish i had a lot of food in my refrigerator only drinks i want some lunch meat some bread and some other stuff finally i got a canopener man i hope i will see that chick from my y psychology class again she is so freakin hot i hope she'll still go out with me even though i heard she has a boyfriend man she has an awesome face and a good body and she is so exciting maybe cause she seems difffernt than most girls on campus she 's not super easy and she seems like so much fun i wonder if she'll like me i think maybe cause she introduced herself to me and maybe she said i was cute i can't remember i'm pretty sure but that doesn't mean she'll go out with me it means crap cause you never know what women are thinking except some who are so stupid and you just tell them what they want to hear i can't believe katie's called me so much she's so crazy i guess i just told her what she want ed to hear yes and now she wants to lock me in for next summer what if i get involved here theni'll feel bad telling her no maybe i wont' but ahh i guess my morals about women are changing maybe i'll just do whatever for a while and calm down later sounds like a good plan my mouth is dry and i'm tired of typing almost done no messages on the phone what the heck i want some messages i hat hangups especially from chicks that pisses me off i hate missing the phone 1:20 done ,1

"i've always wondered how the mind works. what are people really thinking when they say one thing. why do they say one thing and mean another?  people can be so confusing. i wonder what college life will be like, and if there will be people there who will act like that and just say one thing to me while meaning another. it's all so overwhelming right now. computers have never been my strong point, and all of a sudden, everyone wants everything done on a computer. it's strange and somewhat exciting. i like living out on my own, without my parents watching over everything i do, but i am beginning to get a little homesick. i miss being able to see the stars at night and to feel the breeze on my face as it blows my hair back off of my neck. i went to a star party last night, and the stars were barely visible. i wanted so much to be able to see them, but i couldn't. i felt like i could cry at that moment. i didn't though, because then my friend would laugh at me. he doesn't think i'll make it here on my own. i guess i am somewhat of a daddy's girl, but i can be alone. i enjoy being able to hear myself sometimes. i have to be alone to write poetry and to think about who i am. i wonder when i'll figure myself out. i want to be somebody important someday. i want to make other people feel welcome and to make myself feel good about helping others. i guess in a way, whenever i try to make others feel good about themselves, i'm doing it with the underlying purpose of making myself feel good. i suppose that's okay, but it seems to defeat the purpose of helping others when all i'm really accomplishing is helping myself. i think life has so many hidden points that no one will ever find all of them. i wish i could search the world over until i could find all the secrets of the history of people's actions, but that will never happen. people are so secretive that so much history is lost. there are some people that claim that it can be found, but there's got to be more exciting history out there. what would the world be like if everything interesting was discovered. then there would be nothing to wonder about. things would be dull for the future. i wonder if somebody across the world is taking this exact same course and writing this exact assignment right now as i'm doing. that would be the coolest thing ever. i wish on stars every night and feel that life is to be cherished. i wonder if there is another woman out there with my exact feelings and thoughts, that looks exactly like me, only another color maybe or size. so many questions i ask myself will never be answered, but what if someone is watching me right now across this computer lab and wondering how i feel and what i'm thinking at this very moment. if only i knew, maybe i could meet up with this person and tell him'her my thoughts. i would love to share with someone i don't know. i'm afraid of rejection though. there are so many people on this campus, and hardly anyone has talked to me yet. somehow i feel inferior to some of them. i don't know why. everyone is equal, but some people seem so rude. i try to talk to people in my class, because that is how you make friends. so far, i have only made one friend that way. she's really nice. her name is christen. i met her in my german class, and we get along really well. we haven't done anything outside of class, but maybe if we keep talking to each other, we'll become closer and maybe she'll even go home with me to visit my parents. i don't understand the need for human contact. we would be so much better off if we didn't get caught up in emotions and feelings. but then again, we wouldn't be human if that didn't happen. i know i could be more efficient if i didn't need anyone else in the world, but as it is, i have faults. that's okay, though. everyone has faults. it's just part of being human. i hope the world is full of exciting adventures for me. as i come to a close on my writing, i feel purged of all my frustrations. i had a good cry this afternoon. i miss my boyfriend so much, but i know i'll see him again soon, and that makes me very happy. i hope i can become even happier with where i am now. hopefully, i'll be able to find me.

"   yes, i'm finally in college. it feels wierd because ever sinse elementary school the teachers were trying to prepare you for college, my parents were trying to prepare me for college and i'm finally here. it feels good to go home every now and then because i feel important. just hearing the girls in the hallway joking around and laughing outside of my dorm right now makes me love the sweet old college life even more. the smell from my basketball shoes brings back great times i've had in high school on the basketball team and makes me want to try out for the basketball team here at u. t. noticing all of my clothes thrown around in my dorm give me the great feeling of independence from my mother. there is no one here telling me what to do like clean my room. i'm feeling really good about my classes and i'm trying to get over my habit of procrastination. i can't wait until the weekend comes because the music i'm listening to makes me want to go to the club and check out the girls and dance. i'm glad i'm in college because i here that it is going to be the best years of my life and so far it has been pretty fun.

"last night i was almost done and my computer just shut off. i don't really understand why but oh well. i don't usually understand computer stuff, or any technical stuff in general. i hope that they have my packet today at the co-op so that i can be totally done with mis before tomorrow i think that i am pretty organized in relation to homework more organized than usual at least i think that lucy will be a good academic influence on me since she is a good studier its so much different having a roommate that studies since angie didn't do much last year but it is a good thing may be finally i will get to go to sleep earlier and that will make me healthy i still can't believe that i didn't catch mono from angie last year i have a sore throat now i hope that it goes away soon i don't really want to have to go to the health center you never know when th3ey are going out have to take blood and that really freaks me out i can't believe that it is already time to start school again this summer went by so fast and rush was such a blur and we have had no time to recuperate before jumping back into school this semester is going out be really hard and busy i think i thin k all of my classes will be really interesting, but difficult i am so glad that i was able to get out of art history and into philosophy that will be a lot more interesting it is so weird how some teachers can teacher art history so differently so many people told me that they liked it and that it was easy but i know that that class wouldn't have been easy it was such a pain to add'drop though i am so glad that it is done next weekend is the first football game i am looking forward to it i am glad that billy and i got season tickets so that i don't have to go draw or anything it s so nice to have all of them now and especially the ou tickets i doubt that i will end up going to the a and m game  because i bet i will stay home for thanksgiving well, billy can invite one of this friends to go with him i can't believe that he wouldn't stay home for thanksgiving though that surprises me his mom is going to be very unhappy with him i am getting really hungry i wonder what we will do for dinner i wish that billy and i could get together but we are not on the best terms right now i can't believe that we got in such a big fight last night maybe we were just tired i hope that everything turns out okay it was nice of eric and jeff to come over last night sometimes i miss having all those guys next door like last year we had a lot of fun last year together i am glad that cindy and eric get to be together again, but i hope that they are prepared for what's ahead it will be hard for them to adjust out being together all the time especially when the stress from school really kicks in i am kind of getting a little homesick i am anxious to see lauren's new car i can't believe that she is really turning sixteen i am really afraid for her to drive so i hope that mom and dad are taking her out a lot for a lot of good driving experience she really could use the practice i am anxious to see dads' new office space too i hope that he is a little less stressed i know that going out the party last night was probably pretty hard for him, but i am glad that steve a. will be available to help him because he needs some new employees i know that mom is getting worried about him being so stressed all the time but i know that she really is glad that he is not going out minneapolis a lot that was getting really old it was nice to see meredith this weekend it is so weird being i'm the same city as her again i wish tat i could have gotten to see brad too, but he was busy my feelings were kind of hurt how he acted toward me at the party on wednesday night, but i understand they both still seem pretty immature and i am kind of worried about meredith and i hope that she is careful. i am glad that she found a date for the date dash i can't believe that they are all living on the same hall that is just a little too weird for me but that's pat for you i hope that they all have a fun year and i hope that we all keep in touch it was nice seeing ashley this weekend too her room at the house is really nice i think that her sorority house is really nice also it is really big and it must be nice to have their own bathroom and not have to do the community thing i am glad that lucy and i are going to go on a walk i could really use the exercise i am going to try to start aerobics tomorrow i really need too get back in shape i felt so good about myself last year when i was going to aerobics everyday i need to get back in that mode i don't think that i really lost that much weight this summer but things seem to be fitting better now. i seem to not be snacking as much as i did last year which is a very good thing i hope that the food at the sorority house gets better because it hasn't been very good lately but i think that it will get better i hope that billy calls me after he gets home from work he is working way too hard i guess that he won't work next weekend because he will be at the football game that's a good things maybe we can spend some qt together okay this is getting hard of more things to keep talking about i think that i might be repeating some of the same stuff over and over again i hat it that mom can 't really send packages to the apartment but i'm afraid that i would never get them since there is no real apartment address or anything i'm afraid that they would just leave it outside my door and then something might happen whit it i hope that amy and meredith had a good time with their boys this weekend i will go down later and see i have a lot of fun with them we are really similar in a lot of ways i am really glad that they are living at centennial too there are so many tridelts here it is a lot of fun i wonder where lucy and i will walk too we need to somehow walk by the coop i hope that it is not too hot outside when i went out onto the balcony a couple minutes ago it was really hot i think that it will be fun to study out there once it gets a little cooler i am anxious for it to cool down it was so hot walking out class the other day especially to the art building i was so disgusting by the time i got back form class mondays and wednesdays are going to be long now that i go from one to five but tuesdays and thursdays will be pretty easy except this tuesday i have that class from six to eight o'clock which really stinks i wonder why all the good shows start again i can't wait to see the friends season premier and 90210 i am so excited this year should be very good well i am going to stop this now it is now over 20 minutes   ",1
"the channel is tuned to mtv; so there must not be anything better to watch at midday. however, being inside watching crap on the television is better than sitting outside in the hellish heat. when will the madness stop. i write these words in between my 2d design studio class at the art building in the morning and my psychology class at 3:30 pm. myb studio class starts at 8 am, way too early. i write from my apartment in south austin. i get back and forth between school and my apartment by way of capital metro. the bus is convienent  but not so convienent. i don't too much like this computer or any computer for that matter. technology  one day my ruin the human race, we'll have to see. at the moment technology seems to be our best friend, our idle, and to some our lover. that last group of people don't really exsist. materialism is the western way of life. this is why we have so much apathy towards other humans we don't know. some think that if we have our computer to talk to why do we need human interaction. we need human interaction more than we need contact with technology. i would rather have a good conversation with another human than a brief relationiship with a television, computer, or some other device. but what about technology as an assistance to human interaction. this is a good thing as long as it's not relied on too heavily  to subsitute for personal contact. we continue to amase ourselves with new toys, but someday we might second guess our advancements.

"well, here i am; doing a paper that was assigned weeks ago hours before it is due. i do not know what it is that causes me to procrastinate as much as i do. lack of sleep, maybe. laziness, probably. i consider myself a good student, but when it comes to doing papers or projects i always put it off until the last minute. i just got home tonight, its past midnight, and i am tired. i really want to go to sleep so i am not dead during classes tomorrow. i am worried about how things are going to work out grade-wise. this is my first experience with a grading system such as college, with so much emphasis placed on tests and very few other grades. pretty much all my classes are going well, but i am not sure how i am going to study for exams. however, i think that if i keep up my study habits that got me here, i will do just fine. i am really hungry right now because lunch was my last meal and i do not want to eat now because apparently it is bad for you to eat before you sleep. my eating habits worry me too now. three solid meals a day used to do it for me, but now breakfast is gone and one large meal a day is usually all i go for. my head itches a lot now that my hair has grown out. i really love music. no matter how my day is going, there is always a song out there that can raise my spirits. i enjoy all different kinds, and i have listen to a variety since i have started writing. it is quite weird now that i think about it, but music is one of the only things that can truly mellow me out. i have always been a calm, collected person but there is just something about it that i truly love. the whole college experience has been great so far. i love the campus, the professors, and the people. most of my professors give great lectures, and class is actually enjoyable now. i almost look forward to each new school day now that i'm at the university. being on my own and experiencing what life has out there is so awesome, but there are times that i wish i was still back home in high school, not worrying about anything.

"i called her to ask how to cook a  roast. i think it's funny how much i still depend on her - how much i still need her. i call her almost everyday. sometimes just to hear her voice. it seems to comfort me and i don't really know why. thank god she has a  1-800 number at her office, otherwise i would have to call collect and she probably wouldn't appreciate that. when i put the roast in the oven, i  started to think about all the meals she has ever cooked me. i wonder where she came up with all of her ideas. i only know how to cook three meals, and  they are not even that good. i wonder if my mom was born a good cook. she  probably was. that's what my dad says anyway. i kind of hope she wasn't  though, because then there might be hope for me. she told me that she taught herself. i hate when people say that. she had to have learned how somewhere. maybe my grandmother taught her. she told me that she didn't, but she  probably did. my mom doesn't like my grandmother, so she probably doesn't  want to give her credit for anything. i guess i don't blame her. now the  roast is starting to smell good. i love it when you come home and the whole place is filled with a mouth-watering aroma. delicious! but it always smells the best when you're the one who is cooking. i wonder why that is. maybe  it's because you-yourself created it. it's your own little personal accomplishment. i can't wait to taste my accomplishment.

"ok so i'm doing this stream of consciousness writing thing and its a little weird, but then again i love to type and just let loose on the computer what my mind is thinking. so this is kind of fun. i just wish that my strep throat'tonsillitis would go away so that tomorrow (thursday) i can do well in the challenge. and so that i can play well for the clarinet sectional friday night, because i need to pass off the pregame music by memory and personally, i haven't memorized all of it yet. i guess it comes from being an alternate, because half the time we practiced pregame (which hasn't been much) i was forced to sit on the sidelines and watch. oh boy, don't i love watching. i really hate just sitting there as an alternate, because i feel like i'm a cheap addition to the band. like i wasn't quite good enough to deserve a marching spot. but on the flip side, they must think that i'm good enough because i'm expected to jump in on game day and march pregame if someone is sick, late, drunk, or too hungover to march. i feel bad for thinking this but i kind of want kelvin's knee to keep him from marching on saturday. maybe he'll have me march pregame for him, since taps stride is a lot more painful. i don't want to wish that pain on him, though, because he's a sweet guy and deserves to march every game. plus he's a 5th year and he doesn't have many more games left. thank god this room has finally warmed up. or maybe its because i put some pants on. do i smell smoke?? that wouldn't be good. maybe gina and i shouldn't leave the towels over the vent. even though it is blocking the freaking cold air from coming through. oh my goodness this room is so cold in the morning!! holy cow you would think its january, not september! man, sleeping over at rustic's place last weekend was awesome. i was warm the entire night, and when i got hot i just kicked the covers off until i got cold. i guess the fact that i was wearing his pajama pants helped. no nothing happened. he's a really good guy. a christian. his mom has a funny little story about premarital sex. it has to deal with a unicorn. yeah i wont go into details. but it proves that he's a good guy. not to mention i spent both friday and saturday nights at his place. he didn't try a single thing! funny how dad thinks i trust guys too much, and make myself too 'available'. if only he knew me better, he would know that i'm very skeptical with guys. especially after so many of them lying to me. i'm sick of being cheated on and lied to, so i basically play hard to get. i don't think id consider it that, but i don't go easy on them. i'm not the stupid blonde you think i am. i really wish i was one or two steps up on the ladder. my whole life i felt like i wasn't quite good enough. i never won any student council positions, never quite made it to area band, made first chair wind last year on account of a new director but lost it the next semester, made alternate up here at ut, and wasn't elected as newman representative. i don't understand it. i work my ass off to do the best i can, but that never seems to be good enough. why? my dad was valedictorian at his high school, and if i had good grades in elementary school where did the smarts go? why did i all of a sudden screw up math class in 7th grade? granted mrs glover refused to help me, and probably told me the wrong way to solve problems, but still. i did awesome in 8th grade prealgebra, and then algebra and geometry in high school. but once i hit algebra 2 and precal, shit hit the fan. i just hope i don't have to take calculus in college. but since i don't know what i want to do, i may have to. i really need to get that career test done. i've got to figure out what i want to do with myself by next semester. unless i stay in liberal arts, this whole semester has practically been a waste. not quite, because bio psy and band count (for nursing at least), but other than that. i don't know what i want to do. what do people do if they can't decide? take a lot of random classes i guess, but that's not me. i'm coming in with so many hours that i was hoping to graduate in 3 years. that way if i go to law school i can get in and out before i'm 30, ugly, and still single. i hope i meet someone up here. i'm not built to be single or to date for years to come. ahh nose needs to stop itching. why the heck do i have to be sick? i hate this! once hell week was done i got sick. yeah, that makes the first week of school start off real good. let me tell you. oh well. at least i did all the partying last weekend, before all the symptoms hit. and before my parents decided to come in. dangit! rustin has a kappa kappa psi thing at 8am sunday morning, which means he probably wont party after the game saturday night, which means i wont get to spend the night at his apartment because he wont be able to get up and take me back to my dorm at that obnoxious hour. oh but maybe after we paint his living room on monday i could stay over. i don't have a class until 12:30 so that might work! jeez i'm a dork. i need to stop reading into things like this. the time will come when it decides to come. until then i got to sit back and watch things happen. oh look, i have 10 seconds left. dang ",1
"first of all i don't have set prison like rules and regulations. the classes are a lot more laid back and i can do self paced. high school was much more busy work which was crap. i am worried however about how well i do in college. although i did well high school, college is much different. rather than burning the info into you through busy work and assignments, we have to learn on our own. everybody says that they learned more their freshman year than in all of high school. seeing as how i cram all my assignments into the night before it's due, i plan to change dramatically on how my work is done. the influence of my friends also worries me. because of the many groups of friends i don't think i'll have much time to do studying or productive work. i am hoping that by writing all of this down, i am able to recognize my weaknesses and change them before they do any great harm. since this is stream of consciousness i can't help but write about the catcher in the rye, one of my favorite books. since i'm in psychology, i hope that doesn't mean that i'm going to assassinate any powerful people. the book is great written in stream of consciousness and i feel many of holden's feelings. such as the phoniness in society. the phonies in society really piss me off!  back to college, i hope that i can discipline myself and succeed in college. right now i'm listening to red hot chili peppers. i don't know what that tells about me, but i love their older songs. i can make disappear have no fear! music is my airplane, is my airplane. rrahhh!  four more minutes. i don't know what to write. i have so many thoughts but they're not organized. sex of course is on my mind, and since it's the first day of class, that's on my mind. the crazies passing out the christian leaflets is also on my mind. it really pisses me off. not that their spreading the word, because i'm catholic. what pisses me off is that they're so hypocritical. they go out preaching but then turn around and drink it up (under age) and sleep around (pre marital sex!)  that disgusts me. although i do drink a little, i don't go out preaching. many of my friends are atheists and agnostic. i view many of their views such as religion's role in being a social and moral standard. after all, if there was no fear in sinning  then crime would skyrocket and the moral stability  of society would disappear. while that is true, not all will revert to barbaric life. while there are laws, religion adds more to the discipline in obeying the basic commandments. we've had hours and hours of discussion on religion and god. from these discussions i see that many misinterpretations of the catholic faith exist. for example, many believe that (through the narrow-mindedness of the teachers of their religion) that catholics worship mary when in fact we pray through her. they see that as a way of discrediting catholicism by pointing out verses in the bible stating that """"thou shall worship no other god than me""""  or something like that.

"writing about what i am thinking will be a new experience for me. i just got back from psychology class, so naturally i am thinking about psychology. the way i learn is that i review everything said in class in my mind for at least 30 minutes after class. now that i am doing the writing assignment i have other things to think about. my roommate is cleaning out the refrigerator. i honestly think that she is one of the most histerical persons in the world. my other two roomates are engrosed in the television which basically means that they are compeletely useless for the next four hours (unresponsive to almost anything excep for maybe a fire in the house) maybe they will talk to my roommate that is cleaning out the frig. during a comercial. kate, the one cleaning out the frigerator just called the two couch potatoes re and tard, that made me laugh. trying to keep one line of thought is really hard for me. i listen to everything that goes on around me and have to have a thought about it. it makes it really dificult for me to study most of the time. i cannot study at home because i have to talk to all my roommates or listen to them being crazy or something normal (that does not happen very often around here though)  i also cannot study at libraries because i am a people watcher. i like to just sit and watch people. i learn a lot about people that i don't even know just by watching them interact with their friends, or even how they walk. i also suffer from severe migranes, which makes my life interesting when i get a really bad one. i think i have almost overcome them, but i do have one right now. all i have to say about it is aghhhhhhhh. my mind almost automatically switches to thinking about alexander when i have nothing else to think about. he is my best friend and i love hanging around him. he just broke up with his girlfirend and i just broke up with my boyfriend so we have a lot of crying to do around each other. my exboyfriend was really bad for me. it took me two and a half years to be able to say that outloud. i think the only reason that i went out with him, and stayed with him was because he was the first guy to acknowledge my existence. i guess i didn't have very much self esteme when i met him, but now i do, and now i realize how bad he was for me. alright, it think that my 20 minutes are almost up, so i am going to go eat something and get ready for water polo practice. adios.

"     i'm writing this assignment feeling kind of strange because i attempted it yesterdays on my st and my computer froze right when the timer said 19:59. very ironic. i feel very tired right now and really unmotivated. i have a lot to do and i don't feel like doing anything. i wish i could just go to sleep. i need a lot of attention from people these days and i'm just not getting it. matt took my car to san antonio to go to court and he apparently forgot to tell me about it. seems very convinient of him but whatever. he is acting weird, and different but he doesn't know or doesn't see what he's doing. it seems pointless for me to even get angry or bothered by it and i'm slowly beginning to not care. but that will be his loss because he will realize that he should be paying a little more attention to school, sleep, and me then to the things that he is focusing on. maybe i'm just overreacting though, because i seem to do that so well. i don't feel like being here, my head hurts, and i smell burnt popcorn in the hall way. i have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 5. i don't know what the day will have in store for me, hopefully i will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that's bothering me. i need to realize that i can make myself happy and i don't need someone else to make me happy. i don't even know why i'm rambling on about this, its just always in my head i suppose. i hope i get a new car. my dad said i can maybe get something now from the money well get from the insurance. but who knows what kind of car he's going to get me. it will probably be something crappy like i have now. but i can't complain, something is definatly better than nothing, at least in this case. my economics book came in today. finally, becasue i was starting to stress that i was going to get too far behind. i really need to sit down with my books and my notes and try to really comprehend everything. even though i do try but i need more. i need to focus on doing that for all of my classes. but economics and chemistry are the main ones that i might have difficulty in. just because they are very mathy subjects. i might stay at the appartment tonight but i probably won't because i have such an early class tomorrow. well see what happens i suppose. i think matts court started already and he didn't even call me to let me know that he got to town safely. oh well, like i said i'm slowly starting not to care about all of these little things. that might be bad though because it might lead me to not care at all, about anything. it feels bad to feel like you're on the back burner, or that things have changed, though one person might like the change its not good unless both people involved agree with or like the change. i'm so tired right now i could easily go to bed and not wake up until tomorrow. but i can't do that because i have entirely too much work to do. tonight i want to get caught up with my psychology eradings, and i want to study my chemistry and continue to work on hw assignment number two. my roommate just went to heb to get nick a birthday cake. i hope all of that works out ok. if matts still not back ill probably stop by the study lounge to tell him happy birthday but i'm really not into all that socializing that everyone does. i'm usually either really wrapped up with my work or with matt. i don't know how good that is but it makes me happy and that is what counts to me. i just hope it counts to him. oh well. i met with my mentor group earlier. they're all really nice people and i hope i get to know them a lot better as the year progresses. its a pretty fun experience. this weekend should be fun. i'm going to meet up with my friend laura in san marcos and go see some people that i haven't seen in a long time. i hope i can scrounge up something to wear, because i need to do laundry and i need to go shopping,  i have like no clothes anymore, i don't know what happened. my sister is complaining to me about me having her shirts so ill have to give her back her clothes if i see her this weekend. i hinestly don't feel like going home though. it gets too awkward for me. i don't know what but i don't really like it. i'd rather just stay here and study or like watch tv then go home and feel awkward with my family. i have so much to do and i'm starting to stess out and the semester has only begun. i can already see that college is going to be very hectic. i hope i can handle it alright. wow the time is up.

that sucks  what the hell am i supposed to do until then  i have to go to a friends place to type all my papers and send all my email from there  i feel like everything goes wrong at once i mean come on what kind of cheap ass computer breaks after having it for only 4 days  everything else is going fine except for all the meetings and crap i have to go to everyone up here expects so much from me i just sent a thousand people e mails and all the people who i wanted to hear from did not answer and all the people who i did want to hear from never responded  i guess i can't hold on to this false hope that all my friends from high school will also be my friends now unfortunately i haven't made any new friends up here either everyone else seems to be doing okay at making new friend and i don't think that i m antisocial or anything i'm just not as outgoing around people i don't know that well i'm trying to do this stupid thing while watching tv and its not working too well but its the mtv music awards and therefore its worth watching i like music and the radio stations up here are pretty good and they don't play that many commercials so there is a lot of music on all the time so last weekend my friends wrecked the car and i can't take my computer to get fixed  these girls that i used to make fun of in houston are still mad at me up here i mean how long can someone hold a grudge i emailed both of them today and if they email me back then i will know that they aren't still angry with me well my twenty minutes are up now and i can get onto my homework and watch some of the music awards i think that me and my friends might go clubbing tonight and maybe i can meet some good looking honeys ,1
"     what i felt for last few weeks was depression as i do today. i have been depressed for several reasons such as adopting to the new environment, meeting new people, and keeping up with all the works that i have never done before. this writing assignment is another thing that makes my feeling depressed. my hands are getting sweat, i feel my face burning, and i can even hear my heart beating so loud. since the time i started to write anything, i always had fear of writing. actually i am not a good writer and writing makes my feeling very nervous. more than that, my boy friend is about to call me, and i really hope he would not call me until i finish writing this since i only got 20 minutes to do this. well, even though he calls me, i don't think i will answer it, then call him back later and yell at him. also i hope grammer and spelling mistakes won't be counted off from this type of writing. now ii just touched my nose, and smelled cigarette on my finger. i am storongly thinking that i should quit smoking, which i am trying very hard to do. but this moment, i feel like to smoke really bad. smoking always help me getting calm down. i feel totally lonely here, people are talking to each other, and they look like they all got their own friends. i am totally alone here, writing this paper. i felt lonely since i started to live alone. this is my first time to live myself, and whenever i try to sleep at night, i just feel some fear. i do not know what exactly that is. i just can't briefly breath, and now i feel same thing as writing this paper. i think my fear about dark and death started since i was in 5th grade. because of my mom and dad who both had jobs, i had to live with my grandmother. worse than that, i read a book called   i didn't belive recarnation  -well, actually something like that, when i was in 5th grade. that influenced me a lot in bad ways- fearing dark, and death. i am not actually scared of death at this moment since it is bright outside, but i feel similar fear right now. now my hands are getting worse, and my fingers are sliding on the keyboard, and i really don't like that since this computer already has bad keyboard which is very hard to type on. i was not sure if i wanted to do this writing today since there were so many bad thing happened today- internet at home started not to work, i got a bad computer in communication building, and just this moment i pushed wrong key and keyboard did not work for last few minutes. i think i get very easily distractive since i am keep looking at someone else's sreen to see what he is doing on the internet. anyways, it is such great experience that made me almost cry, and now i will count off ten until this page shuts down. is it usual that i don't remember what i listed up there? well. its been over 20 minutes, but it says i can keep writing. but i am not going to write any more since it is promise between the direction and me. hope i am a few of people who are honest.

"     i'm already starting to feel stressed out, and i haven't had any tests yet. it's only been two weeks of school so far, and i feel like i have so much to do. i guess it's typical for for an incoming freshman, since it's new and all. i've never felt so busy in my life. watching tv, my old passion, seems like such a waste of time to me now. if i have spare time, i could actually be checking out austin, like the duck boat, which our ra told us about. it seems so cool!! a tour bus turning into a boat ?? it's craziness, and a little scary. we supposedly may go as a hall, which i highly doubt because we don't seem to have hall unity or whatever. i guess i had a misconception of how dorm life would be. at this point, i think getting an apartment would have been just fine, other than the fact that i'm way closer to my classes living on campus. ok so maybe dorms aren't so bad because i don't think i want to wake up like an hour earlier for the whole public transportation fiasco. i really need to figure out the bus routes because i don't know where any of the buses going other than forty acres and far west, which i accidentally got on to during orientation. it was a great detour. wow, 20 minutes is a long time, i just realized that. i guess i was comparing it to how long it takes me to do everything else, it seemed like nothing. so yea, back to the stressed out business. i've had something to do since the beginning of summer, since i took summer 1 at a community college, then i went to clinton, oklahoma to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister-in-law out with the hotel they own there. i worked and got paid. good stuff. a few days after i got home from clinton, i made my way to austin. my new home in the kinsolving dormitory with all the other chics. and i think we all know how busy things are around here. i thought christmas break would be relaxing and chill time, but i was mistaken. for i found out my closest cousin is getting married january 15, the weekend before classes start. this means that for christmas break, i will be helping out with the wedding, which from experience already i know is very stressful. and my cousin has asked me to do a dance at her wedding, which is an indian tradition for a younger girl in the family to entertain the guests with a vivid dance. so now i have to pick a song and choregraph a dance and learn it to perfection so i can perform it in front of hundreds of people. did i mention that i am a nervous person who freaks out easily ?  oh and by the way, the wedding is in new mexico, and the reception is in houston a weekend later, so i have to go back home after a week of being in austin, followed by who knows how long of being in albuquerque, new mexico. my home is in lufkin, a little town of pop. 35,000 in east texas, just two hours north of houston, 3 hours south of dallas, and four hours east of austin. man oh man, this is going to be a hectic year. and to think i thought studying for my classes was my biggest worry. well maybe i will grow from all these things, in stead of losing my mind. i guess we'll see. hey, that kind of relates to psychology huh ?  maybe i can be a case study, which i read about in the textbook.

"i feel a little tired. it is cold in here. maybe i'm tired because its cold in here. why a writing this paper?  am i going to be judged on what kind of person  i am by these rambling thoughts that i type down. i'm still mad that i lost my remote control to my reciever on the move up here. it will probably cost around  30 dollars to get a new one. you know i found it impossible to clear your mind of all thought, because to be able to do this you have to be thinking to remind yourself your not supposed to be thinking. dad's birthday is this weekend. probably going to go see him. i wonder how the new restraunt is doing. i wonder how mark likes running it. i'm getting kind of hungry. to bad there is nothing to eat though. man i need some money. maybe i'll get a job working on my days off so that i can have enough money to eat. i still need to read chapter 2 in my psychology book. its a pretty cool book i like the qoutes by the different people. this computer is under 1. 5 tons i would say. man i need to get out of the house. all i do everyday go to class come home eat study watch tv go to sleep. and then the next day get up clean the place up eat study watch tv study shower well i guess i shower the day before two and then go to sleep. ut is very different. i had 40 people in my senior class and everybody was extremly friendly. here everbody is different. maybe they weren't raised the same as me to be polite to everybody. that alright. i'm sure i'll find some friends that have the same views as me. whats the deal with all my classes talking about how depressed you are supposed to get. its kinda like they are telling you that if you don't become depressed then you arent normal. maybe i will, just to be like everyone else. nah. maybe i should start lifting weights again or swim. man this is weird. i keep thinking in the back of my head that this is supposed to be stream of concious but for some reason i keep trying to make sense on way i saying. damn that really scared me the dang air conditioner just made a helluva loud noise. that reminds me of the questionare that i had to fill out for the experimental research for this class. are you afraid of spiders do you constantly look for spiders do you dream of spiders thats crazy. hey that reminds me of saturday night live. thats crazy. that pretty funny. mispelled thats. oh well. one minute left tick tock tick tock  tick tock oh no time has stopped 2:34 am that is what it says why is it when you notice time it goes by so much slower ding ding 2:35 our time here is done.

"my name is ashley mitchell and i am getting ready to write everything that crosses my mind within the next 20 minutes. right now i'm thing about all the reading i have to do for my classes and what am i supposed to do with myself since i don't have a psychology book. the book won't be coming in until monday. i believe in god so i now that he will make a way for me to get my hands on a psychology book. what tv show comes on tonight and how long is this scholarship dinner going to be. why does the rugrats tv show come on in the middle of the day. what is my sister up to today? when is their next battle of the bands? my back hurts from typing so awkwardly. it's only been 4 minutes. it seems like i've typed everything i can think about. the lunch was pretty good i had i just wonder was it too fattening. i need to call the football trainer and see if i can get in touch with him. i need to start making connections now as a freshman if i want to accomplish my goals. hhmmmmmmmmm. i don't think the new romeo show will be any good. i need to go and practice the piano since i haven't practiced since i left home. i need to find an organization that's perfect for me and i think the texas gospel is perfect. hmmmmmmm. i've never met the professor yet and i really have no idea what this class is going to be about. it seems like it could be interesting though. i'm glad i made the decision to come to ut. i feel like i've made a major change with myself. spiritually, socially, and physically. i've grown up with black people my entire life. at first i thought that it was going to be a total culture shock, but i shocked myself when i found out it's pretty cool to meet people other than your own race. i enjoy being with my people and all, but sometimes in life you have to step out and do something for yourself. if i had a went to a school with most of the people i already knew i probably wouldn't make any new friends which isn't good. i need to get a job when i get back to houston. what time is it. what time does my psychology class begin. it begins at 3:30 so i still have plenty of time. let me put my folder into my bag so that i won't leave it here. boy i sure don't feel like walking to class in this heat. burdine hall is too far away. i know that it's good exercise and all, but i just don't feel like walking. i don't see how people can stand to live in austin. there is nothing here to do, but go to school. at least i haven't seen anything here that would make me want to live here. i need to turn the tv volume down a little so that i can really think. i'm going to work out today. it feels good to work out. my roommate is probably wondering what am i still doing typing on the computer because i have been on the computer for almost and hour and i've been typing for almost 20 minutes straight with slight hesitation. so what is prof pennebaker going to do with all these thoughts when he reads them. my head is itching and it is too cold up in this building.

"why do i have this pimple? why does it matter what people look like so much? i am sure that if we were all turned in inside out, and what was inside of us was on the outside, well first of all, we would look pretty damn disgusting, but if who we were was on the outside of our body, the world would be better. i am sure that there wouldn't be as many people wanting to show off their """"body"""", because their new """"body"""" would be who they were, and not everyone is happy with who they were. i went to my first college frat party last night, and it was one of the worst nights of my life. my best friend and i had this inclination to go there and do nothing but talk to people. he has a girlfriend, and i just didn't want to meet a girl there for other than friends purposes. it was horrible. it was crowded as heck, the music was too loud, so that in order for anyone to even understand you, you had to use a megaphone, and to be socially """"accepted"""" you had to have a beer in  your hand. now, one might think that would be an excuse, but i didn't see, but 15 out of at least 200+++++ without a beer. for some reason, i want to spell beer, bear, but don't let me please. thanks. :o) well, it was so dumb. my best friend and i walked around the whole time just walking, because in this one room, the music was so damn loud you had to use a megaphone to talk to people, and i'm not all about that. i am not the stud who has all the looks, but can't talk to people worth a damn. it doesn't matter though, if you are that stud, because the girl is too busy dreaming about your looks that she doesn't give a poop what you are saying. i am more a people person. i like to make people laugh. i don't do it on purpose, like go out of my way to make people laugh, but it's the way i am. i have this quirkiness (thanks sooze) about me, but i love it. i don't want to be that stud that can't talk, because i am pretty happy with myself, until last night, when i had this feeling going into this party that girls in general had changed. my whole life, i have been nice, and i go by the saying """"nice guys finish last"""". i had this feeling that it might all change in college, but the answer is """"nope"""". i was at my friends house, and her roommates were all telling me that it had changed, and that girls now were looking for long lasting relationships, and they didn't want all that highschool bullshit that they had gone through before. okay, i know this sounds superficial, but these weren't bad looking girls either. two were pretty darn cute, and the third wasn't too bad at all, so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. i hate using the word ugly, and i hate judging people. i don't. i always hear my friends going up, and saying """"aaron, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly"""". okay, first of all, i am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. why? why does it matter what he looks like? why can't he be a  nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. how he treats her. what he does for the world. what is up with this world? i never say that shit, because there is no reason for it. i hate saying """"oh, he is ugly"""" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, i am not the best looking guy on campus, and i have no right in heck to say that. i hate hate when my friends say it. but, it's the world. college was supposed to be different. the time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. it hasn't quite been that, and granted, i have only been here for a couple of days, but i am scared. i am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. i mean, i go out and meet people, but i don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. we say when we leave """"see  you around"""", but have you realized the size of this campus. it's freakin' amazing. there are 50,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. it was supposed to be different. i mean, don't get me wrong, i don't have 12 eyes, and i have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. i get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. it's not that i am looking at all, because i am in love with sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when i walk into a room, people stare. i promise you this. if who we were was what we looked like on the outside, i would get those stares. thank you for your time.

"this is very odd trying to track my thoughts by doing this. all i can think of right now is i can't type as fast as i think. i am slow at typing in general but this makes it even harder. so lets see what do we talk about. today i have a long day cause i have four classes and i don't get home until late. mondays and wednesdays are my longest days. anyways, this weekend my goal is to be caught up with all my reading and all the things i have to do for my classes. i have been enjoying college so far but i don't like the work aspect of it. there is just so much reading and constant memorizing and remembering it. it wasn't like this in high school but then again i am not in high school anymore. let's see what else. my roommate spelled rice all over our room carpet just a minute go and now the room smells like chinese food. she cleaned it all up but now the rug is greasy. so after i finish typing i will clean the carpet so it's not so greasy anymore. i am looking at the clock and i only have been typing for 5 minutes. i am tired already of this. i am looking at my little cousins' pictures right and i miss them very much. it's lonely here in college but i am working on having fun. but there doesn't seem like a whole lot to do that doesn't involve alcohol in some way. everyone seems to just want to get junk and pass out and not even remember what they did the night before. i am not much of a drinker and certainly not to the point of getting junk and passing out. i like to just go out with friends and hang out and talk like we used to, but most of my friends are so spread out that we have to do the email thing for now. i like email because its' just wonderful. there are no long distance charges and you can send it in a second to anyone anywhere in the world. oneday people are going to not be able to remember their lives before email. i don't even think they can now. i still can because i was just a freshman in high school when it first started getting popular. but i still like the days when we were not so technology driven. i like the later 80's and early 90's. though i am not that old i can still remember those times where things didn't seem to be so fast paced. and now everyone is trying to be millionaire and wanting more and more of material things and just wanting to have a """"good time"""" and not really caring in depth about things and people. its just use and get ride of the next day. but then again there are other people who don't do this. i don't know. now i am looking at the clock and seeing that i have been typing for fifteen minutes now and my fingers are getting really tired. i am glad i ate before i did this cause then i really would have been annoyed with this. looks like it's going to be another hot day. i want it to cool down but i don't want it to rain when we have to go to class. it can rain on the weekend but not while we have to go to class cause that would cause more headaches. anyways, i just want to be home right now. i want to be in my car and drive to the mall or just whatever. i miss being at home and i didn't get much of a summer this summer cause i was so busy preparing for college and making a list of things to buy and packing, and going and being in camp and just lots of stuff that i needed some more time of relaxation and enjoyment. will i have about one more minutes of typing so i guess this is it. i don't know what i am even saying. oh there i hit the 20minute mark ok i am going to stop typing now, goodbye.

"i didn't sleep at all last night and i'm barely making it through my day. i feel like a zombie, but hey what's new?  i have an english paper due on monday. i think i completely bombed the thesis. i guess i can always go back and change it. i'm tired, i can't think. that's a lie, of course i can. it will simply be rambling nonsensical jumble. and that counts too right? sure it does. i've been seeing this guy. he's about seven years older than i am, and that shouldn't be that big of a deal, but it's more of an age difference than anyone i've dated before. i can meet him on an itellectual level, conversation isn't lacking, there's physical attraction and the whole deal. so why am i so doubtful? i suppose because i'm paranoid about becoming an obnoxious needy stereotypical girl. unfortunately i have been that to others in the past and refuse to ever play that part again. i'm so much stronger now, more confident and comfortable with myself as a person. anyway, my point is i'm scared to let him know i'm sincerely intersted because i think it will freak him out and send him running in the other direction. i can make my intentions known without actually verbalizing my feelings. and i'm pretty sure at this time in the relationship- whatever time it might be- is too soon to bring up any of those concerns. is he seeing anyone else? does he care? does he not want to hurt my feelings so he won't tell me he doesn't want to hang out? it's so ridiculous to hear myself think like this. basically i'm so afraid of rejection that i'm willing to do it myself, before anyone really gets the chance. i've dated a plethera of losers over the past year and i'm tired of not caring about anyone. anyone in that way i guess. yes i have friends and have plenty to do without a guy to entertain (that sounds really harsh- it is me that wants this. )but i miss that connection. i want to be in love again. but who doesn't? i suppose once i stop wanting it i'll find it. that's the way of the world sometimes. yeah but about him. it is what it is and if it doesn't work out than so be it. plenty of fish in the sea and all that. but he does have some potential. enough of this. it's making my head hurt. i don't like that my stream of consciousness has turned into more of a """"dear diary"""" than anything else. i'm sitting in the student microcomputer facility among my fellow longhorns at the moment. i wonder how many of them are doing this assignment right now. maybe none. everyone's in their own little worlds. deep inside their thoughts or their research. everyone seems so disconnectced, though i suppose that's the point of this place. a quiet area to get work done, not social hour. i'm about to go to ecology evolution and society. i've been reading the assigned chapters, but i fear that i'm not actually retaining any of the information. i guess it will become quite apparent when i get my first test scores back. all i want to do here is to do well. it's the only reason i'm living in austin again, to continue my education. so that's what i aim to do. make the most out of the billion things i have to accomplish today. cross them off my list and get them out of the way in order to make room for all the new. life is pretty enjoyable when you don't let it drag you down with the minor negative aspects. so many people do that. drown in their own self pity and reamin miserable regardless. just smile sometimes, it really can make you feel better, and probably someone else as well. that's what i think, but this mind of mine is all over the place and never seems to rest. the end. my time is up.

"     whats up im tearing awwaaayyy  my name is hope i like fish, and stuff like that, sarah's music is loud so it is hard to write i think. . my room has lilo and stitch in it a lot, my doll is funny from that movie it is green, it's name is rogelia i'm not really sure how to spell it. the suite mates across from us are very loud, they like to laugh a lot- it's not really laughing it's more like cackling and shouting at the same time. . this drowning pool song is a good song but the lead singer died the other day. i wish my hair didn't take so long to dry and straighten and everything it gets annoying and makes me mad sometimes  the phone is ringing in the room across the bathroom they're so loud    i like goldfish i'm glad i got them from the campus store. . grace is yelling 'give me a break' and clapping they are so loud it took me awhile to learn they're names because they're both so loud and its hard to distinguish them- i forgot my apostrophe in that it's but now i guess i don't need it   i wonder what brittany is doing today- she doesnt spell her name like britney so i always try to write it like britney spears. i haven't talked to her in awhile i really should call her more often but she lives so far. it's such a long walk. plus i should call candi, but candi doesnt call me so i don't know why i should    i don't know if she moved in with her boyfriend or if she lives at home, she invited me to hang out with her the other day and then her cell phone broke- i called taylor's cell phone the other day  uh-oh incubus  (not sure how to spell that)  and actually no i messaged taylor and it said it was his sister and he told me he had a new phone and gave his to her but i don't believe him. taylor has cute hair, just because he's original with it. i miss the mall and visiting taylor at gadzooks before i went to work, i liked walking past there and seeing him, then seeing ashley and toni at electrocell, then going up the escalators to journeys and saying hi to russell and krystal and hollye   krystal owes me 50 dollars she has been so mean lately because she's so obsessed with her boyfriend   i don't think that a boyfriend should mean that much to somebody, they're just going to screw you over in the end, and you're going to need yoru friends to fall back on, unless of course you alienate them like shes done to all her friends. i miss kirkland's too, all my buds were there-it wasn't the same though without amber and brandye- i felt so bad for amber this weekend because robert didnt call her back- just another evident sign that boys are trouble    eddie is probably trouble i don't know why i like him   i can tell he's just another liar like aaron-  aaron broke my wittle heart i can't believe i let myself trust him, it is kind of upsetting to think how much he upset me and i still kept calling him, i won't do that again,, sarah's playing limp bizkit; at junior prom ben reagan drove me and we listened to limp bizkit on the way to dustin's house i thought it was unromantic, i can't believe dustin's dating amanda- shes actually pretty nice i went to that foam party with her the other night and she was cool   however she did call me and her and jenifer asked me to go to the game with them but when i said i didnt want to they said 'but we need your extra ticket'   awww our lady peace they are so awesome i was so happy that erin went withme to their concert even though she doesnt like them. i was kind of mad that she dragged us from the front near the stage to the back because she was hot    elimidate is onn!! i love that show, cody was on it and won, i wonder why cody hasnt called me maybe he thinks he'll get in trouble because he's a teacher and i'm a student or maybe i'm just not good enough for him    i don't konw but i should go back and visit ms. brinson and tell her i'm thinking about switching my major to art or architecture. i don't know i think architecture would be more fun then architectural engineering thats hard to spell. . . i would like to design things i just think there's not a lot of money in architecture or especially in studio art, but my mom says there is    she was really cool about my losing my check card the other day    i was so upset about it especially when i thought i had lost my ut id thingy too  that woulda sucked then i couldn't have gotten food i think that i type too fast, all the freshman in my bcis class last year used to stare at me and be like whoa she types fast   and i'd be like yeah thats because i'm cooler than you. scott was in my class and he knew amber but he always called her nicole. i'm sleepy its 11 pm i think i should be in bed considering i have class at 8 tomorrow   i hafta go because i have to turn in my homework,   jenifer hancock and me worked on our homework together today in the study lounge,  when she took the top off her bottle-o-water it made a funny noise and i remember getting mad for some odd reason. . i want to go home this weekend but i think my friend's are going to want me to go to some parties with them  however   i don't drink so i don't think it will be that fun. sarah is doing her homework online i like when it says 'correct' i'm glad that sarah thinks the neighbors are loud too, i guess at they're house screaming this late was acceptable   omg and that girl yesterday sitting outside our door on her phone, what was she thinking???? she knew we saw her and she was just being loud to be mean i guess and i just wanted to open the door and be like hey i can hear your whole conversation and i am trying to study so couldyou be q-u-i-e-t please but she wouldnt have understood anyways. . if i were to go home i don't think james would want me there, it's not really my house anyway, i hope they're watering my plant because i love it! especially the little pot its so small and fat   there was a pot like that at kirklands that crystal always talked about how cute it was and amber thought that i said krystal was a size 13 but i meant the crystal at kirklands and it was really funny i thought it was sweet how they got me that cookie cake   i am so mad that my mom left all that stuff in the fridge, and my shelves and parakeet from kirklands on the floor of the apartment   whatever there prolly weren't even any fleas i mean she got her zelda books but she couldnt get my stuff???  she said i left some shoes there i hope i got all the cute ones   what else was there i don't remember oh yeah my sea monkeys they had gotten big, there used to be a buncha little ones and now theres just a few big ones i thought that was funny i'm going to hafta get some more because thos were pretty cute ",0
tony just walked into our apartment and ashley is asleep. maybe i need to work on some other stuff. this pre-testing page is down. it keeps shutting down every time i try to use it. i wonder why i even try sometimes. why am i doing all this stuff enter night. into night  grain of sand. off to never-never land. i just typed metallica lyrics. i don't even like metallica   this is kind of weird. i don't think that i can keep doing this for 20 minutes. ashley's starting to wake up now. at least most of my studies are done because i'm going to play broomball later tonight. do i play at trees or not?  i just think that it will be too hard to actually get to dallas in time to do it. i can't relax enough to do stream of consciousness. i'm completely aware of everything i'm typing even though it's not selective. boy tony is loud. ashley's so cute when she's sleeping. she's starting to wake up. oh wow. i can see her underwear. she'd be a bit embarrassed. she's up know. and gave me a big smile.        now she's laughing at me. now she's trying to talk to me and distract me from my work. going on for twenty minutes?   my word. i don't have time for this. i think i have the psychology department figured out but i think they just have everybody take these intro psyche classes so they can get info for their own experiments. they just make it look like a class so they have a bunch of subjects. a cigar. i could use one right now. i'm so stressed out. i'm tired of that bare naked ladies song. zach is talking to me right now. what a moron he is. . just about random stuff. . yes go on. exchange the genesis for mario kart. that's a good idea. we're getting mario kart. . i guess i'm going for twenty minutes. . it's been a long time. i have no more to write. i'm going now. by3e. ,1
"i am so mad right now that i can't believe it. i wrote out an entire  stream of consciousness thing and i pressed cancel instead of submit which  erased my entire writing assignment!!  i am so angry and tired and i just don't feel like doing this anymore. i can't believe that i am so stupid!! why am i doing this anyway??  it doesn't seem like it's doing any good  and i don't see what it's serving. i don't have anything to write about anymore and i don't even know if i'm doing this thing right in the first place. i don't know if i'm supposed to be pressing enter at the end of each line or if i'm just supposed to write to infinity on one line or if i should press enter. i don't know. i don't think i even care right now. i'm cold too. my dorm room is always so cold. i don't know why we put the ac on so high maybe because austin is always so freaking hot!  why is it so hot anyway?  i hate texas. i wish that we never moved from nj; the weather was always so good there it was never too hot or too cold. i miss my friends too. i don't know what to do right now. or what to do when i'm done with this stupid assignment. great, i have  about fifteen more minutes left. what the hell. why is this taking so damn long sorry about the swearing but i'm just really pissed right now. i'm also tired  because i went shopping with my girlfriend today for over 7 hours and i'm  so fatigued mentally and physically. how do girls do it?  how can anyone possible walk for seven hours straight and not get tired. in that respect i completely admire them. wow. not left with anything left to say. i must have . who the hell is making so much noise in the hall way?  this dorm is always too loud!!! i just want to move to an apartment and get some privacy. i hate these public  bathrooms, they're so unsanitary. i'm having trouble breathing now. my  asthma is acting up again. probably because it's so cold in here. i wonder what my girlfriend is doing right now. she left in a hurry after she dropped me off. that's the gratitude i get for going shopping with her for so long. i bet  whoever is reading this thing is hating the fact that i can type 65 words per minute and i bet she is getting tired of reading all this crap. i'd go crazy if i have to  read ten of these things, much less over three hundred. man i can't breath. i need to get my inhaler. i think i need to go to the bathroom too. but i can't leave this computer to do it. oh boy. what is life getting to?  wow only ten more minutes before i am done!!  and i still don't know what to write about. those  people sure are making a lot of noise out there in the parking lot. oh. i wonder who won the ut football game?  i guess we did since the tower is lit  up orange. but i wonder what the score was. i think i need to ask someone. not that i actually care about football in the first place. my leg is itching why do we have so many nestle crunch bars laying around here anyway?  i think we need to give some away. ouch i just got a really big stomach ache. all of a sudden i'm really really tired. i want to get some sleep. i never get enough sleep in college seven minutes left. good. i need a haircut. i'm too tired to think. my ear canal itches now my face and shoulder itch. i can't do this anymore. i'm debating whether or not i should just submit this thing and say that i wrote for twenty minutes since i type faster than most people anyway. no one would ever be able to tell the difference. only five more minutes. i can't think of anything to write. i need to call my girlfriend but her line was busy the last time i checked. i think her roommates are on the phone line. need some sleep why the hell can't i just stop??!?!?!?   i'm so tired. my arms are getting heavy. i'm not thinking  of much anymore. can't lift my fingers. think i'll just sit here a while and hope that time will fly by quicker. easiest thing to do is zone out and not think of anything at all, that way i won't have to type anything. but then  again here i am still typing. what the hell. i can't win either way. i need my inhaler really bad now. i can hardly breathe. only one more minute. can't think of anything to say getting really really anxious now. come on. um. i guess that's it then. i've got no more to say.

"what a waste of time. these guys are so hung on the fact that they can't decide whether they want to be this one or that one or if they can hack it. how stupid. it is really loud in the other room and i hate when people have their deadlocks one and leave the door open so it always slams when it closes. what should i do about mike? it is a really confusing situation. i wish that gabe would ask me out again. smoking is bad. justin just asked king dobie if he wanted to go smoke and it's gross. to relieve stress about all this frat shit. racism is bad. i don't understand why can't people just respect the fact that everyone is not going to be the same color as them. i am open-minded about it because i lived over seas and sometimes i wish that people would be able to have this experience so that they could understand  a little bit about another culture. you learn a lot about your lifestyle and your own country when you are not surrounded about it the whole time. but right now i don't feel surrounded. ronnie is still probably crying over his ex-girlfriend and i feel his pain i have been through that before with chris, i wish here was here a lot of the time but i guess he isn't. he is probably with carley having sex which sucks for me to be thinking about because i think she is a really bad influence on him. i just hope he takes care of himself and doesn't screw up too bad at a&m since he already screwed up by even going there. imagine that . to be an aggie that would suck but i guess in a sense i am being prejudice against the aggies. they are a whole different culture but i hate to be called a hypocrite. someone called me today and it was my best friend in the whole world. cole is the man. i miss him so much and a lot of the time  i wish that i has a friend as close to me here as he was to me. he is at westpoint and i feel bad for him, no sleep and lots of pressure to do well. i hope he is ok. i miss him and he needs my prayers, which i need to do. i got to get back into the swing of things,. i would be letting cole down if he knew where i am at with god right now, he is my accountability partner and i feel as though i am letting him down by not studying the word. i will probably go to metro on tuesday though and hopefully i will take someone with me. maybe brian will go. i hope so, i wonder how sarah and wade are. i miss seeing here and was pretty mean sometimes. brad on the other hand seems very worried about his job and i scared for him! we clicked really well at work and i wish we could spend some quality time together sometime but i don't know what he has been up to ?  i got to go to bed soon. i was very stupid about waiting till the last minute to do homework but i do it all the time and i don't know why i surprise myself every time that i wait until the last minute to do stuff. speaking of which i need a job. where the heck am i going to get a job. i need money to pay for crap that i don't need, like sweats and shoes that i would add to the collection of almost 40. lauren just walked in the door and i knew because i recognized her voice. she is weird but in a great way. only 4 minutes i think. it seems like twenty minutes is such a short time when you are babbling your thoughts to a computer. mike is weird and he has this annoying laugh that drives me nuts. so does gabe but gabe's is cute, or am i just trying to justify it because i think i like him. probably i do that a lot. i can convince myself that something is good when it isn't and the exact opposite. it sucks. i never know whether to believe myself or not to. just like when i talk about sex, i don't want to have sex until i am married and i have made a  commitment to not only myself and god but to my future mate. wow that is scary. thinking about marriage. """" just what every girl dreams of. their wedding day. """" but i hate to be out in the category 'every girl' i am my own person and i feel like i am unique. ",1
"hi i guess i'm supposed to be thinking about what to write for the next 19 minutes and 20  seconds, i will start with charlie my boyfriend of one month exactly today. long distance thing is  working out ok, i may be falling in love with him but then again he is going to be a cop and i  always said that i shouldn't marry a cop and he doesn't have a job right now so he can't take me  out that often. does him not having a job make him lazy? i'm not quite sure, when i was like 14 i  made a list of the basic things that my future spouse should have i wonder where i put that or if  he would fit into any of the standards i set for my self. he is the best guy i have dated so far, as  far as how he treats me and respects me so i'm doing all right for myself. i wonder what casey is  doing never mind she just walked in she says this asignment sucks and i agree maybe i will sue  you all for giving me carpal tunnel syndrome casey is leaving again, what a freak not really she is a  cool girl. i just ate so much food added up i had a fajita and a cup of chicken enchillada soup  and an ass load of chips and queso, i'm sure that i am the most gigantic person on the planet  what if i get heartburn from that queso. i am experiencing the sickness brought on by the lull in  my immune system brought on by the stress we talked about today in your class, yes  pennebaker, we do listen and you are quite entertaining, hope i don't forget to read the entire  semester, but at the rate i'm going that's what will happen, i wonder if you are married or if you  ever date your students. god bless your students if so. just kidding. i can't believe that i am not  going to have sex for like an entire month. this is craziness. i usta me borderline nympho. just  kidding again. hmm what shows am i missing on tv for this assignment, and are you all actually  going to read these assignments, i wonder if anyone writes a suicide letter in this or like  confesses to a crime. i stole a pen out of a lisa frank stationary set at walmart last year, but half  the stuff was missing out of it anyway and the pen was the best thing left, i think its somewhere  in my car there's lots of crap in my car, i need to clean it good and i need to have it washed the  leaves from the tree i park under are fucking up my paint. my mother would slap me if she  heard me say fucking up anything. hmmm. deep breath i have gone 12 min 52 seconds so how  much longer do i have? i suck at math, i have another homework in there. and i hate homework. i don't really consider this homework, ugh the word homework really gets to me oh yeah i now  have lets see, 6 minutes and something, gee where is that lighter i'm not going to be able to  smoke for like until i find it. after staring at this screen for 20 whole minutes i'm going to have a  headache and ah, the thought of being with my boyfriend, that's what they are talking about on  tv that would be great i miss him i wonder. did i already write about how i wonder what you all are  thinking about what i'm writing. i seem pretty neurotic. this is a fairly easy asignment. what  lawyer should i use to sue you all for this? not that i actually would or that i have grounds to sue. 3  minutes, three is my lucky number. uh. my fingernails need fixing. two. broken. what's a girl to  do? and to think that i don't have a nail girl to go see and i'm freaked out by the oriental people  to do my nails, so i'm pretty much screwed. count down-- 1 minute! yay i guess i will be seeing  you all around hope you enjoyed this tour through 20 minutes in my brain. its scary i know. alright  then i love charlie!!!!! i can call him now he will be so pleased. !!!!! bye ",1
"i am watching mtv cribs with chris pontius. today was hot and i'm supposed to go running with nathan but it's still too hot so i want to go later. maybe i'll get some of my work done before then so i won't stay up so late like i have been lately. i'm really tired so i took a nap today and slept like a rock. i don't know when i'm going to supper though because i don't want to eat before i work out or i'll feel sick so i might just get nathan to cook for me tonight. i am starting to miss everyone from back home because i'm not usually away from my family, friends, and sam for this long. i guess i will just have to wait a couple more days to go home for labor day weekend. i want to go home to see everyone but i really don't want to go to the football game and that's what all of my friends are going to want to do. i'm running out of things to think about because the tv is on and it's distracting me. the song on this commercial is going to be in my head now for the rest of the day. i like all my classes so far but i'm still kind of scared. especially about biology because my prof is going really quickly over the information and it's hard to stay up with him. i'm getting tired looking at this computer screen. my eyes are getting droopy but i can't get tired and go to sleep now because then i won't get anything done and i won't be able to sleep well tonight. just like last night i couldn't fall asleep forever and then when i finally fell asleep i kept waking up so i felt like i didn't sleep at all. my strawberry smoothie was really good just now. i'm kind of hungry but lately i haven't felt that good so i don't feel like eating. maybe ill just wait until later when my roommate wants to go so i'll have someone to sit with. i hate going to the cafeteria without knowing someone because then i sit with people i don't know and we're always eating so we can't really talk with food in our mouth but i want to meet them and not be rude. i'm sure they understand because here at hardin house all the girls are really sweet. they are all in sororities though and me and my roommate madison are they only 2% not in one. oh well i have way too much school work and other stuff to do and i know if i would have rushed i wouldn't have time for anything else and i really need to do good this first semester and get it behind me and get used to everything. my back has been hurting a lot lately because of an injury from track season but i can't get into a back specialist for a while so i kind of just have to live with it. and i love to exercise but it hurts me for days afterwards. i decided that i'm just going to start working out and if it hurts oh well because i really don't want to gain the freshman fifteen. ha. my boyfriend goes to school in lubbock at texas tech and it feels so different not being able to see each other everyday like we used to. it seems like we fight every day no matter what and yesterday was our one year anniversary so i went and got him a present saturday with my mom at the mall in san antonio. she wanted me to go back to hondo with her just for the weekend because her and my dad missed me but i wanted to come back up here for the weekend and party with some of my friends. my parents got to see my yesterday though. they came up after lunch with my grandparents and they brought even more stuff for my dorm room. my mom has been keeping herself busy at home by being creative and making cute things to decorate with but i really enjoy when she brings me stuff. we went to eat at hula hut on lake austin and it was really good like seafood'mexican food. i've never had a shrimp enchilada before then but it was great and my dad ordered an awesome dessert tray that we all shared and loved. then we went out on the deck and watch all the people on the lake and just talked for a while.

"i can't believe i am doing this, and that i actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that i have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least i think that is what you call it. to tell you the truth it is actually easier than i thought it would be, i expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. but i guess i am coping with it and handling it the best i can. though i am always afraid that i will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. actually, that is a true nightmare that i have had before. which reminds me that i have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. which i guess is because i have just moved here from a really small town. and when i say small, i mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. now compared to that austin is a real shocker. i guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. so many things are different and yet so many things are the same. a funny thing happened when i first moved here a week ago, i found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. just think of how many apartment buildings there are in austin, and i unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. and she and i only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other,  i am already looking forward to the christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. i am so tired of this ninety degree weather. i can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. but i guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. that reminds me that i have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because i am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and i want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. more than likely it won't rain, but i know that if i don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. i don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually i don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so i finally told him that we would come watch him this friday. he's supposed to be really good. but i don't even remember what position he plays anymore. the reason that i don't really like football is that i don't understand the rules very well, and i think that if i knew them better then i would be able to follow along with the game better and enjoy it much more. i am not much of a person who likes sports and athletics much anyway. i like to do more calm, less active things. one of my really good friends happens to be getting married this weekend. i wonder what the wedding will be like, considering the man she is marrying is so strange. i wonder how long that marriage will last. but i am glad to be going to her wedding, because i will be able to see all of my old friends from high school again, and catch up with what they are doing now. i haven't seen them is a really long time so that should be interesting. well, i am way past my twenty minutes, and must get to class, so i must end here.

"     ok so im sitting right now in my dorm room writing my first ever college assignment. college is not at all what i expected. its pretty much highschool except you don't have to attend your class and theres no curfue. my dorm has been asssigned (some might call it imprisoned) in jester. its quite a new experience. i awoke last night at exactly 3:43am to find my neighbor blasting rap music. now i am not one for rap music and especially not at night. not knowing what to do i layed there in misery and ignored the 100 decibal speaker system which i was dreaming about smashing. now that i think about it next time this happens i'm marching right over and banging his door down. college is such extreme independance in my life that at times i cannot handle it. back in highschool i had a midnight curfew, now i can come in at 4 am and no one can say anything. i can eat cookies and chips and never eat actual food and theres no one to stop me . but this is not the reason i came to college. i was not escaping my parents, i came to ut because my views and beliefs are shunned and immoral according to my smal texas baptist town. i remember recieving an f on an english paper in which we were told to write about our feelings and my feelings were inapprpriate. how can someones beliefs be inapropriate? ut is the most liberal college in texas and even though i can barely afford it to me being exposed to different views and being able to share my views on life without being blacklisted are worth every student loan i have to take out. now i do not know what i am   not allowed   to type in a college paper. am i allowed to tell you that i am an aethiest? am i allowed to tell you that i loathe culture. well whether i am or not i do not care anymore. i cannot stay trapped inside and never know if others share my views. its a horrible feeling to not be able to speak out. its the worst kind of hell anyone can go through.  i cannot express even to myself how much i find people who have religous beliefs stupid and ignorant. religion is a sorce of comfort for the idiot and a powerful tool for a leader. anyone with the slightest bit of common sense can see that the three main religions in the world , christianity , judaisim, and islam are almost identical and yet they all are an excuse for war and money. religion is bullshit, its all a story made up my a power hungry man who proclaimed himself the son of god to gain a following. if others are allowed to express their love for god then it is not wrong for me to express my hatred of him.  i look forward to this class and intend to make the most of understanding the stupidity of some human pysche. even though im an engineering major i find this subject interesting and intend on embedding what i learn in this coure in my mind for the rest of my life.

"     stream on consciousness, this is something i have done before, when i was writing my diary, i though it'd be a cool idea, i wrote down a lot of stuff, some having to do with music, some having to do with my boyfriend. he's a good guy, i miss him sometimes, well i do but i don't- it's not really an active missing, it's a passive missing, like i know i do somehwhere in my heart, but it doesn't hurt or anything i wonder what that could mean? everyone always asks me how long we'll last, and even though i'm not sure, i guess well last a long time, i mean its already been a year, which really doesn't seems so long anymore, only a few weeks maybe, until i really think about it. then its much longer. even though it all doesn't add up at first- it makes sense somhow. you know? it all makes sense when you look back at it all. i tend to think in really long streams and then my mind pauses, as if to switch subjects, not really to- well actually sometimes, to reflect on it- but i always inevitably move on, i wonder if that's what veryone's like. if they all reflect on their thoughts like i do, then move on. or if they thing continuosly only shifting smoothly from one thought to the next. there has to be someone like that, somewhere. maybe in china or some other country, but some where. i refuse to think that people all think the same, not only because people are inherently different but because even if 99% of us wer the same, there would have to be at least one person who's not. that's just the way i think. ellipses are fun, they provide space, and soetimes a depth that no other literary device can reach. i'm not sure if depth is the right word of if tis truly a literary device, but ellipses are (thoughts search for word) something that people use. woah, a mental stumble in words, i wonder how oftne i do that? i don't think i realize when taht happens, that reminds me of foreign languages- i like foreign languages. rightnow i'm taking dutch- but spanish is the one i'm most versed in. i think in spanish sometimes, its kind of fun, and i have always found it interesting that someone could actually think in another language then they'er own. i used to think when i was a little kid that that would be impossible- then i though itd be incredible, now that i can do taht it just seems like fun, i like it, it feels. comforting somehow. i'm not sure why. it must be because my goal is to be fluent in as many languages as possible- though i'll probably do only four or five- someone in my class has a father that knows seven. i find hat amazing, it's simply amazing what the mind is capable of. medicine is fascinationg to me, not just the cure type, but the physiological aspect of the human boday, and the relation so the psychological part of the human body, has always fascinated me, even when i was younger. i suppose i've always had a fascination with biology and the like and that is what has led me to this point in my life. its like my whole life up to this point has guided me to this exact path, and in a way, to this exact moment in time. perhaps only to point me in another direction. (looks up at light) not all the lights in this library are lit, i wonder why. maybe its because it would be too bright, or maybe because the sun is still out, or maybe some of them burnt out. i wonder if there's a pattern. (searches for pattern) no, there doesn't appear to be a pattern. not lit. lit lit lit lit lit lit not lit not lit lit all the way down the row, lit lit lit lit partially lit not lit lit lit lit lit all the way down the row (lost her place) ah well. worth a shot. i search for patterns in things a lot- very scientific like. that one police officer told me i sounded like a doctor. he asked me what i was going to ut to be and i said i was going to major in biology and become a doctor and he said """"you sound like a doctor, in the way you tlak"""" i though that was kind of weird at first, but very logical. i am analytical by nature and tend to use larger words than many people, though they are not always right in my head- when i say them they come out right, and not only that but i love biology, and finding out what makes us tick, and wen i'm in an argument i try to see all the sides- and to see what's underneath it all. for instance i try to see what the ohr person is saying and why. what makes them say that. why they say it the way they do- i'm going to like this class- i like psychology. psych= mind. ology= the study of. i was in medical terminology. actually the class was called health science tech, but the main part was about medical terminology and working in the clinical setting, i worked at the hospital but instead of money i got grades, particiapation grades reall. it was fun, even the parts most would consider gross. i enjoyed it- but i don't think i want to be one of thos doctors tthat work in the hospital. i think my typingg is louder than everyone else in this library, the keys aren't the easiest to push. they stick a little, on some letters more than others. they're like keyboard keys that get stuck because you were careless and spilled soda on them, but a little looser. they're not quite tahat stick at all. but still they seem so loud. the guy outside in orange is drinking coffee- i like orange soda. its my favorite color and soda, good stuff. i wonder how much time people spend observing things outside their little bubble. if people had a bubble of consciousnes, it would be their immediate surroundings. just basically what they can touch, or what they can comfortably read. i wonder how many people ake time to see beyond that and what they're like. what type f people they are, if people really do have type. basically, what they're like inside. ar they analytical, whimsical, forward thinking? are they lacadaisical? what are they like? am i really one of them? i kind of think i might be or maybe one that is in between that and the other. maybe i'm right in the middle of two extremes like fire and ice, heaven and hell, earth and water.

"i just finished taking the prescreening survey and i could not help but feel that some of those questions were ridiculous and repetitive. i'm not even sure that i will agree to participate in any extra surveys even if i'm qualified. i don't feel comfortable being subject to any questionable tests - the guinea pig feeling makes me feel lesser, i guess. i have a lot on my mind concerning a specific event that happened yesterday, and i surprisingly feel comfortable talking about it. i feel alright talking to people, but somehow it's different typing my feelings onto a screen. this screen represents nothing to me right now, i don't know if anyone will ever read or really care about reading this. somehow i'm still making sure that i am spelling words correctly and using acceptable grammar. anyway, the event that i found out about yesterday. involves losing a person that i knew in high school. i can't stop thinking about the fact that just two years ago we were sitting in the same classrooms and wandering the same halls, and now one of us isn't here. it's very clear in my mind that we weren't the best of friends, but we shared the same circle of friends and some of my best friends knew her very well. i personally haven't spoken or seen her since graduation, but i knew she would accomplish everything she wanted and do it better than anyone else. now that i think about it (and i can't stop thinking about it) she is one of the most brilliant people i have met in my life. she graduated 5th in our class, and spent this past summer at princeton for a research project; definitely someone who was going somewhere. i never thought that something like this could happen to one of """"us,"""" the people that basically built the foundation for the person that i am today. i know we weren't the closest that friends could be, but my best friends are wrecks right now, and that affects me. it's a direct and indirect effect, not so much one thing with a yield arrow leading to another thing, but more like a huge web of thoughts that are clinging to me. i'm tangled and i'm not sure where this leaves me. i hate that i can't remember the last thing that we said to each other. nevertheless i was perfectly fine knowing that she was off in her world, and i was off in mine, both separately pursuing the things that we love most in the world. it's not fair that her life wasn't complete enough for her to fulfill everything she wanted to do. it's not fair that they found her the way that they did; it's not fair that we don't know and we won't know for a long time. the truth of what happened. everything is so complex. i can't call anyone; i mean, i can call, but i don't know what i could say that would offer any comfort. it'd be different if i were there with our friends, must to hold a hand or sit next to someone who understands. nobody here at ut went to my high school, and i doubt that anyone on campus can come close to saying that something like this happened to somebody he or she knew. i feel alone, i feel helpless, but at the same time i feel like i'm connected to everyone else who knew her because, well, we're all probably feeling alone right now. college is supposed to help us branch out and find ourselves, become good individuals in this world. at the same time, in the time between our high school graduation and now, we've all become isolated from each other. it sucks that it takes something like this for me to finally feel like we belong together and that the time that we spent together was precious. all time in the world is precious now. things that i was worried about before i heard the news, any stress that i felt weighing on me in the past week has disappeared. homework and little things seem trivial to me. in a way things seem simplified now: we either are. or we aren't. just being here doesn't seem right- but is it selfish to be so so glad that i am here?  i wonder if i deserve it, or if i can earn my place here. then again, who knows if it's so bad on the other side. i see that i have less than three minutes left to stream my consciousness. what a perfect day for me to tell my feelings to nobody in particular, and for them to disappear into a screen as soon as i press """"finish,"""" yet for them to linger in my mind still. any other day i would have felt that this assignment was worthless, but i'll admit it. feeling like a part of myself is being put out there-a huge or small risk, i'm not sure-makes me feel the slightest bit better. maybe ",0
"wow i really need to shower but i'm going to go work out later so that is ok. maybe tim will come and abbey and mike, they would be so cute. i don't know though but i'm glad tim called me yesterday. the flowers aunt michelle sent me are getting old where should i put them, i guess in the waste basket thing by the stairs. i wish i could use those but every time i go down for lunch you can't get in from that staircase, its annoying. i'm really hungry. i was not supposed to eat the snickers and kit kats but i mean i practically had vegetables for lunch so its ok, plus its the weekend soon and i don't want to waste it. i forgot to go draw my tickets, i never know when to go. i should look it up soon but i can't go now because sunny and abbey have not given me their ids and its probably too late anyway. and lets see only like an hour till psychology, i want to sleep but ate the candy so i'd stay awake and its working i mean i'm a little tired but not too much. i went to bed around like 1 last night but i wanted to study more, but my roommate was sleeping and she gets mad or annoyed sometimes when i turn on the light, like its a spotlight on her or something. anyway kinda pisses me off and i have to do everything in the dark which takes forever, i have to brush my teeth, take my pills, do my nose drops, lots of stuff. and then she wakes up really early - well she had a class, but she didn't wake up to her alarm and i did. and then when she left it went off again and i still had an hour to sleep before i had to get up to get dressed. it was cool though. my room is nice and clean now, the maid lady came because she forgot to come yesterday. i can't really do this if my roommate is in here, oh well. she is about to come in, i hope i can focus! this is really hard to think of things to say because i have never really paid attention to my stream of consciousness. i don't know if i'll be able to draw my tickets tomorrow because my classes are in the morning and i don't know what time it closes. probably all sold out anyway, so many people here. but its funny because i'm not meeting as many people as i'd like to, but i have only gone to like one frat so. i'm glad i met tim though, that was kind of random and he is really cute. and abbey seems to like mike, who really likes her, and they would be cute too. but abbeys is either changing a lot or living a lie, she goes to frats like 4 times a week, its crazy. and i have been friends wither her for like 10 years so i know she procrastinates so i hope she gets her work done. i don't think she is though because she always says she has hw and then leaves to go party or something, whatever though. we might go get coffee later at barnes n noble, its such a far walk. i don't need coffee either but i think abbey thinks i'm mad at her so i'm going to go anyway and just study i guess. i mean i knew college was a lot of studying but i didn't think it'd be this much. maybe because i'm such a slow reader. i only read about 20 pages per hour. and in the textbook its only 10 per hour. its so slow and so many pages. i finally finished the psychology homework like 2 hours ago, it was sort of interesting but i hope the next chapters are better. i don't think i'm retaining anything. which is bad because i read for so long that you'd think i'd be learning it. i get psychology confused with philosophy and then can't seem to remember either of them. but in class i listen and i get it, then after i try to think about it and all my classes run together. yesterday was especially bad because i got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment. i made a 71 and it really pissed me off because i worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and i trusted it. he also didn't do some examples on the board correctly, which made me get another one wrong. today he was all ?oops? yeah it made me mad. but oh well i can drop it according to the syllabus that i don't have printed out. i hope whoever reads this does not think i'm a psycho or anything, or can't spell because its either a typo or i just don't spell well. i really am a good student though and i'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and i have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off, and it sucked. i was in the bathroom at kerby lane and i cried when i told my dad, i always do that. its good that i have bangs now because if i were to cry or not pluck which i need to do, you can't tell that much. i'm funny about crying, i do it when something really touches my heart, which is kind of often i guess. but pain wise i'm pretty tough, i played basketball for so long. i'm so accident or injury prone. i swear i always get hurt. at the football game that hurt so much when i stepped on that glass i think there was still some in my foot but beth said there was not. it does not hurt anymore so that is alright. i just hope everything goes well for me i mean i really wanted a 4. 0 gpa but now i'm scared. maybe being scared will hinder my performance, so ill stop worrying about it and just trust that i'm smart enough. twenty minutes is almost up.

"     how much time do i have before i need to do some more homework. this week is going to be pretty busy. it is hard to find out what is due and when because their are way to many different places to find out. all the teachers should use the same service. this would make it much easier for students to keep up. my goal is not to fall behind, but i have missed some classes of geology. i need to find out what i missed. that class is going to suck. i wish i had a car so that i could get places farther than a mile away. i hate writing. i hate typing. it is hard to write down everything you think. our minds work 5 or 6 times faster than one can type or speak. so if we could talk faster, we could get up to 5 times the amount of information to someone else, leaving us with more free time. this would shorten classes and anything that requires communicating. i'm glad my spider bite went away. it sucked that i had to go to the health center for it. they gave me a shot in my ass. it left a bruise, but it didn't hurt until an hour or so later. it just sucked that it was on my face. it made me nervous when i heard that corterzone lowers the immune system because i had been putting it on for many days. thank god the over the counter medicine does not do harm. i spend much time alone now that i moved away. luckily i enjoy being by myself. it is nice to have the peace and quiet. the parties are fun, it is just that i would prefer to chill with just my friends, not a million people that i don't know. i don't know too much about bull fighting, most other sports i have played. i do not see the glamour, passion, and joy of bullfighting. it seems barbaric to use ones instincts  ",0

"i am sitting here trying to start writing, but i can't. i have this problem a lot when writing for my english class, because i never do the reading. this year, however i decided that i would try doing the reading assignments, and it has helped me immensley in my classes. however, now that i am doing the reading in my chemistry class, i see no reason to go to class, because my teacher doesn't understand the concept of teaching, so i basically learn nothing. i often wonder if i am too hard on teachers because i want to be one. in my classes, i always seem to evaluate the teacher so i can figure out what to do and what not to do. in high school band, i spent a great amount of time evaluating my band director because i had such a problem with her teaching techniques. i see music education as a field in which you should be a teacher, not a technician. my band director was not a teahcer at all, but only a technician. we never learned a single thing about music, but she was great at teaching kids how to play instuments. my add is kind of annoying at times, because i will be trying to concentrate on one thing, and my mind wanders off to another place. i am thinking about this girl in my music theory class who is very good looking. i think i am going to ask her on a date this weekend. i am not sure what i am going to do though, because my father would not let me take my car to school. sometimes i think he trys to get out of things by procrastination so he can save money. i mean, he gives me everything i need and most everything i want, but i feel that he is trying to make me think he is going to do one thing, and when the time comes he just finds an excuse to not do it. i have tried, however to start holding him to his commitments. part of the problem is the fact that he trys to do too much in a 24 hour a day, 7-day a week week. he never pays anyone to repair anything for him. he does it all. cars, house, electronics. i am glad, however that i have grown up knowing and learning how to do repairs from such an extremely intellegent man. i'm sure it will come in very handy one day when i have a house and family of my own. in fact, it has made me want to have a house of my own so i can have something to work on of my own. i'm excited in general about my future. i want to be a music educator, teaching orchestra. i love music education and orchestra so much, but i sometimes wish i was getting a piano degree, as it is my first love. i have taken piano most of my life, and i greatly improved this year, mainly in the past 3 months. i sometimes wonder why i smoke cigarettes, as it is a stupid habit. why would someone willingly put smoke into their bodies. i guess i enjoy it. i don't know. most of my friends smoke mariajuana, and it doesn't bother me. i, on the other hand, have never done it, and i really have no desire to. my sister was a somewhat heavy weed smoker her first year in college, and she ended up with a gpa of 1. 9. i don't want to get kicked out of ut my first year, and i want to be able to say that is something i have  never done. my father works on top secret programs for the government, and he says that if anyone trying to get a security clearence has a history of drug use, they are automatically disqualified. i might want to someday become an engineer, and i would like to do what my father does. that is one of the main reasons i don't smoke weed--i don't want to screw that chance up for myself ",1

"""" etc. , etc. he insisted he was ready and my dad was pissed off at him. didn't speak to him the next week. his brother, my uncle, was in las vegas when he died. as much as it makes me angry, that's one of my favorite stories. my grandpa has always had a mythical aura around him and that tidbit only lends validity to it. i just found out a few months ago that he had another daughter with someone other than my grandma. my grandma knew, but didn't mindit was before they got married. my grandma also is dead and my dad and uncle knew very few details about it. when i got back from las vegaswhere i was told of the newsi looked through my grandpa's old wallet, something that apparently everyone else forgot to do. there were only a few pictures in there. my grandma, my uncle, my dad, and this little girl with a blue dress. my grandma told my dad that grandpa gave a blue dress to her on her 5th birthday. speaking of favorite stories, i got a job back home at a video store. i worked there because i was enamored with the manager; she's only a few years older. but she's great, hilarious, beautiful, everything and there's no one who doesn't like her. before she opened the store one day she was in the local fry's supermarket and this older lady came up to her and said, """"you are beautiful. """" meredith, the manager, said, """"thank you"""" and went on her way. then she realized the lady didn't have to do that and that was a very nice thing to do. so she went over to the florist, bought a bunch of flowers, found the lady, and gave them to her. the lady thought it was so nice that she invited her to dinner that night. i think that's a beautiful story.

"i hope no one heard me yelling and screaming for the cowboys game. that was the most awesome season opener i have ever seen. i really haven't been keeping up with the boys but i'm glad i got to watch them. i really have been missing football. i can't believe i haven't even been to the longhorns games. i watched their games more when i wasn't even a student here. i guess i got so caught up in the spurs mania happening in my city. that excitement will be hard to beat. i remember the night the spurs won the championship i was downtown because my friend since first grade was having a graduation party at la villita. i knew i had to go since i was so close to her family for so long. her mom was my coach. i still call her coach. anyways, analissa promised that there would be a tv there for me to watch the spurs game because i am a die-hard spurs fan. several years ago when they would play really well during regular season but then lose in the playoffs, i would go in the guest room, put my head under the pillow and start to cry. i was embarassed that i was crying but my hopes had gotten so high and they had really let me down. so when they finally had an awesome chance at winning the nba title, you better believe that i wanted to witness it. i was so disappointed when my friend didn't have a tv at her party. i seriously wanted to cry. i am not just one of those fans who likes their team only when they're winning. i had been waiting so many years for that night and then i didn't even get to really enjoy it. i wonder if anyone is writing to professor pennebaker about their sexual thoughts. i bet he is thinking, """"that's not what i had in mind when i told you to write anything you're thinking. """" back to what i was saying, i was so desperate to see the game that i called my friend on my mom's cell phone and told her to call me and pretend to be my mom, telling me to come home because if the spurs won it could get too rowdy downtown. so i left with my best friend, but i felt really bad that i lied to her family, because her mom was thanking everyone who showed up to the party despite the fact that the night would go down in spurs history. she said that we were anie's true friends. ouch. so rae ann and i walked downtown to different smoky sports bars trying to find a decent place to watch the game, which was already three quarters over. finally we just went to the marriot hotel and found a tv. there were a bunch of drunk older men hitting on us, but at that point i could care less, because i was so into the game. i wonder if the professor is going to think what i'm writing is boring. my roomate just came in the door. she was out of town for the weekend. i hope she doesn't mind me using her computer, cause i still haven't gotten mine yet. back to my story, i watched my game and we won of course and it was one of the happiest and adrenaline-running moments of my life. how pathetic right? just kidding, but it was exciting just like the game today. i wonder if eddie saw the end. i know he had been watching it. i hope he calls later because i miss j. c. i love their apartment. i definitely want to move there next year if i have enough money. those were the best apartments. an artist must have designed them, because they looked so modern. i'm looking at my watch and there is a minute and three seconds left. this assignment is really neat but it is kind of hard to track my stream of consciousness when in my mind i know i am writing for an audience of at least one person. oops, my watch is beeping- time's up.

"why must it be so hard?   why must i live like this?  would it not be better if i simply throw away my life?  it would be so much easier. i wouldn't have to worry all the time about people's criticism. i wouldn't have to worry about making mistakes. but then, i'm human am i not?  aren't we social creatures?  if i seperate myself from others, would i not cause myself harm?  would i not also cause others pain?  a life lost is a gift lost. it is so difficult for me to live like this. always in pain. but sometimes i gain a sense of glory when i live through the sufferings. it's as though these sufferings are meant to makme stronger. like steel being tempered in a hot flame. yet, there's still more pain to come. will i survive?  surely there will be a point when i will not get stronger and break. but then how will i know where my limit is?  whether i live a mediocre life or on to te fullest, i will die. however, it seems as though the latr fashion of life is better. therefore, with spirit, i will strive to live out that lifestyle. i try each moring, to fight the tempatations and do what is expected of me. if i live this way and think that it is the best way. should i not persuade others to do the same?  why not?  it seems that if everyone lived their life more fully, mankind will be more efficient and fruitful. we will  prosperous as  whole. but if i were to tell this opinion to others, someone will tell me that i should respect their opinion that they can do what ever they wish. but if it is right to repect all the opinions of all people. would there not still be a conflict which contradicts that opinion that says that we all must respect the opinion of all?  for example, what if someone else's opinion is that people should not accept all opinions as truth. would not the opinion of the person saying that we should respect all opinion be contrary to that opinion?  this brings about a lot of contradictions. hence, notall opinions are to be respected.

"     college? i wonder how it will be? i just started it. it seems so nice and easy going as of yet, but i wonder is it something i will enjoy and cherish for the rest of my life.         this is my first time living away from home and the ones i love and care about it. i feel the necessity to show to my peers that i'm not scared and do not miss home. but in fact i miss my home and my sister who i fought with all times. i don't know why i feel that it is important to show to others that i'am not home sick. i can't understand that part of my mind. is it because i want to fit in the croud? is it because i want to show others that i'm strong?           on the other hand - i love what i have been experiencing for the past week. i have experienced things i have never before. i never had to do mylaundry myself and now i do that and i find that i like doing it. i have to go to eat myself. at home the plate was always on the dinner. i feel as if i was spoiled at home and that i was given too much. here i realize that doing things for yourself can be as much as fun when people do things for you. and that to be self-reliant does have its advantages.  i have learnt to handle things on my own. at home, if i met someone i didnt like, it was as if  i ignored them but here i realized that it is difficult to ignore 55000 other students and that you have to adjust and compromise so that you are not the one that is ignored by others . so far i can say that college has taught me more than i thought it would.          college is not the only thing on my mind. i think about my life as a hole-like how will it turn out? how will i manage to survive financially? if i will make a good living in the future? i question myself why i think so much about the future and so little about the present. i give undue importance to the future and not to the present. my thinking aobut the future helps me ruin my present. things done turn out the way i want them to. i end up sacrifcing every moment that could have been precious over things that i cannot make precious or things i can't control.          but thinking about the future does not take my mind off my past. i question myself if i really do believe in god. my faith in him is torn apart each time a tradegy happens in my life. losing my grandfather was a big tradegy for me but i coped and realized that he was old and it was his time to go. but when i lost when my father, i really started to think if there was a almighty god since he took away the person i was dependent on emotionally, physically and financially. i decided to look on the positive aspect of life and decided that my mother was still here and so god was not so cruel. but when i lost her at the age of 13, i thought forget god. he doesnt exist. however looking at people who are religious and have faith in god, get everything in life, is making me question of my faith in god. i wonder if he can make miracles happen in my life too?        i used to always think about eating food. but since the past year that it had changed. but i'm back to the way i was. i wonder if i'm a emotional eater? when i was depressed in life, i always resorted to eating. however when things improved i stopped eating and now that i'm sad again, i continue to think about eating. i would love to visit a shrink to get to know if i'm a emotional eater.

"today is a bad day. my boyfriend and i of 2 years just broke up because he is     at another university and is rushing right now. i have always been the center of his     world and now he acts like he doesn't even want to talk to when except for when it     is convenient for him. his roommate told me last night that he has cheated on me     and when i first heard that i got so sick to my stomach and had to run to the     restroom. jared, has been the ony guy that i have ever loved and i thought i would     marry him. we spend holidays together and i am already a part of his family and     he is part of mine. to think of him being with someone else just kills me and i am     so torn up right now that i cannot concentrate on anything but him. i had to end it     because i cannot continue to be hurt when all i have done is devote my whole life     to him. he assured me all summer that things would be fine with us apart and that     if he was to join a fraternity that it would never get in the middle of what we had     together. my thoughts are horrible right now and i never thought that i could feel     so hurt and ashamed. my biggest fear is that he won't even care because he will     just move on since he is so involved and has so many opportunities to meet other     girls. jared has been the sensitive one in our relationship since day one and he     was always worried about me forgetting about him. he was always the one that     couldn't stand not to see me for one day, and he was so in love with me tat     sometimes i got annoyed by it. now the tables have completely turned because i     feel like i am incapable of functioning without him. for the past 2 years, everything     has been about him and so now i just don't know what to do with my time. where do     i even start without him there to say i love you at night , or without him there when i     am having a bad day? this is the worse feeling i have ever felt and i just wish he     knew how it was to be thinking about him every second of the day! he will     probably just go on and not even miss all the times we have had together and just     party all the time like he ahs been for the last two weeks. i helped him move into     his new apartment and was not invited to come since, but all of our friends have     gone over there and seen him, so why did he have to put his own girlfriend in that     position? i have not been real happy lately as it is because i just transferred to ut and     i hate it so far. i don't see anybody i know during the day and i feel so lonely     without jared, and now it will be permanent. this is the worse time for this to happen     and it makes me feel sick when i think about how it probably won't change. we     have always been so in love and people know us as the perfect couple and now     there is nothing perfect about us and all i feel is pain. he is going to the school that     i did last year and is meeting all these new people and having all this fun while i     have been sitting at home dreaming of him and this is what i get for it! i kept telling     myself that it was going to be hard while he was pledging but now its going to be     much harder never knowing what he is doing without me and wondering about     him every day. i am lucky to have a great family that supports me so much to help     me during down times like this, but they have never seen me like the way i am     today. i have seen other people hurt this bad and i just thought to myself that it     must suck to be like that and now here i am in their shoes. he is the guy that has     always put a smile on my face, made me feel loved and made me a better person. i go to sleep at night thinking of him and i wake up in the morning thinking of him. we have had problems before and after a few days he couldn't stand fighting with     me and would brake down and tell me that he hated when it was bad. i keep     telling myself that if we don't talk for a while that he will realize what he ahs lost     and call me explaining he loves me too much to lose me, but i have such a bad     feeling that this time is different and he will just move on. i don't want to move on     but i have to keep myself busy knowing that he is out all the time with other people     because when i think about it too much, it tears my heart up. this is the guy that i     have planned my wedding with and after just 3 weeks of being away he has     already given me up. we have all the same friends and i will not be able to hear     about what he is doing and be able to see him anytime soon until i start t feel     better. i have no energy and it scars me because i don't even want ot do my     homework of study because my mind is in such a  different place right now. he has     put everything in front of me and his roommate told me that he does not think he     cares as much about me right now since he is so caught up in rushing and meeting     people. it just kills me to think that i am here and he is there without me because i     have always been included in everything he does. now all of a sudden i am shut     out and i hope he realizes that he can't live without me. it is so hard for me to think     of him with somebody else because i know everything about him and what he likes     and does not and i don't ever want another girl to be that close to him. i love jared so     much and i wish he wouldn't have ever left or that i would have stayed there     because things could be different right now, but he enjoys making me jealous     when he talks about all the things he is getting to do. i know that i must just live     day to day knowing that things will get better but right now i can't see myself getting     over this for a long long time. i feel worthless today, am i am a very good person     so what did i do to deserve this? i am just hoping and praying that things can be     patched up between us one day after we both have some time to see what life is     like without each other. i just don't want him to throw everything away, because he     is the best thing that has ever happened to me. i talked to him this morning and all     i could do was cry and when we got off the phone is that feeling that anybody     would hate when saying bye to someone that they love as much as i do. i am only     wondering what he will do for the rest of the day and if i will ever be on his mind     because i usually know what he is doing all the time. i am supposed to be the one     who goes to these parties with him and i am supposed to be with him when he     meets other poeple so they know that i am his girl and now all these girls that have     been in love with him while we have been together are going to love that we have     broken up. i am going on and on about how upset i am its just very hard because i     had never loved anybody before him and it breaks my heart to think of being     without him. and as  for school, i hope it gets better it will just take some     adjustments. i hope jared still loves me as much as he always has!

"right now i am simply writing and not feeling anything in particular. i am somewhat upset right now though because my throat is hurting, and this is due to the fact that i have started smoking a lot more than usual. i am a pretty sensitive person so i think that is why it hurts. who knows. i also am feeling a little unmotivated at the moment and i can't figure out why. this is the time in life when i am supposed to be super juiced to go out and get what i want, to grab life by the horns so to speak. this is not happening though, and it is kind of scary. throughout my life i have been pretty much handed everything i have either through the mediocrity of others or through my own natural abilities, or a combination of both. it scares me to think that i have never applied myself fully to anything that i have ever done, and have still managed a somewhat successful, although underachieving, life. it makes me wonder a few things though about myself and what i have in store for the rest of my life. i don't know if i actually know how to apply myself fully to something, and if i do will i actually be able to stop and apply it to something else. this not only applies to me with work and school but also with personal relationships. up to this point i have many friends, but very few whom i can actually call close friends. they are just there because of attrition or because i was what some people might call popular in high school. i wasn't popular because of my stunning personality though, but more of what i was;  a basketball player, an intelligent person, and somewhat goodlooking. when i got to college and found that there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this i found out that i am not at all who i thought. i don't really know who i am and who im not, and i am kind of scared to try to find out. when i finally decide what i am will i like it?  will anyone else like me?  will it make me happy or will i learn to hate myself because i disdain the person that i actually am. they say that you can be whoever you want but this is not true. you can try to be whoever you want but for some reason you cannot always be this way because there is something deep down inside of you that knows better. if i try to be a suave cool underpressure type guy, but fall down a lot, it doesn't really fit. i can want to be that way so badly, but it may never come true. if i accept that fact that i am a goofy dork will i like what that will get me. i am going out on a limb here and saying that women aren't exactly falling all over themselves for goofy dorks. at least not ones that i have met just yet. perhaps this is just society pulling on me, and i should just accept whatever i am. the true question how do you find out who you are?  i want to know so bad that it hurts, but there is not equation to find out. you just have to go out there and do it, and i am too scared to do it. i don't want to end up like the rest of my family, just sitting around waiting, feeling sorry for myself. i feel so much safer and better though when i just stay within myself and don't wander out of my comfort zone. my guess is when you do the wandering is when you find out who you really are. i don't see the oppurtunities yet. i am still waiting and wondering, hoping. i guess if i knew how to talk to people better than it would be easier to find out who i am. when i talk to people though its like they want to get away from me as fast as they can. they look down on me and they don't even know me. i don't understand why this is, but i am afraid that it is because of   who i am  . i think i am doomed to always be this way, and it scares me. i don't want to  be this way. i am too needy for random people to want to be my acquantance, friend, what have you. i expect too much too fast and it scares people fast. people accepted it in the past because they   wanted   to be my friend because of who i was, but alas now that is not the case. so now im stuck, clutching onto the past like a has been with no real hope of ever stretching out and completing myself. then i will be like the rest ",0
"well, i just got back from my zeta meeting. it was cool. after the meeting, we went to this show where this guy hypnotized people. it was so funny!  some of my pledge sisters where some of the subjects. it was hillarious to see them and the funny things he made them do. i can't believe i waited until now to write this. i'm usually the type of person who gets things done ahead of time. i think all of this freedom makes me feel like i have nothing to do. i missed a homework assighnment in kinesiology the other day. i couldn't believe it. tomorrow we're going to have this """"relationship talk"""" with the delts. it's going to be really fun, i can't wait. this time is going by really slowly, i just know that i'm going to run out of stuff to say. i'm really hungry, i haven't eaten since 5:00. i've noticed that i eat more often now. i think it's because i work out (or try to) three times a week. i always feel so much better when i work out. hopefully, i'll be able to keep it up for the rest of the year. the dreaded """"freshman fifteen""""  is not going to get me!  this thursday, i have a meeting with my doctor about my knee. it's been giving me problems. i had surgery on it last october. the crappy thing is that my other knee is starting to feel the same way. god, why was i born with ghetto knees?  okay, i feel like i've been writing forever and it's onlt been 10 minutes. i am dreading all of the writing i'm going to have to do next semester. english is going to suck next semester!  i've never been any good at english. i don't enjoy it in the least bit. on the other hand, i love this psychology class!  every day i get to come, i look forward to it. our professor is hilarios. i don't know what it is that makes him such an awesome teacher, he just is. every day, i come home and tell my roommate all that we discussed that day. i enjoy reading our textbook, i actually find the information interesting!  (much unlike my other classes)  i wish psychology was a more job-promising field. i would definately look into it if it was. okay, five more minutes, i think i can bs my way through it!  i'm waiting on my this guy kevin to call me. i'm not sure what exactly he is to me. we're dating, and we wouldn't date anyone else, but i feel funny calling him my boyfriend. okay, my roomate just blared the tv. if i did that while she was trying to do homework, she would eat my head off!!!!!  okay this last minute will be used to sign off. i wish all of my writing assignments were this easy!  there, d-o-n-e!

"   i really like doing this assignment. i did it in my senior ap english class many times. i think the assignment was really interesting to my teacher, and that is why we did it so often. i am having a little trouble with this one though because there isn't  rally a topic. my english teacher would usually give us a vague topic, just something to get us started. some of the topics were going to college or music or sports or something like that. my favorite topic was always music. i think music may be the most important thing to me other than loved ones. i listen to it a lot and it makes me very happy. it is very important to me. but i think what makes me the most happy is playing the guitar. i love creating music. i think it is very gratifying. i may not always play real well, but i am always making some sort of music, even if it sounds terrible. the guitar is probably a kind of escape for me. i really forget about everything else when i am playing. it makes me feel so good. but i think i can do some of m best thinking when i have the guitar in my hand. i f i am just sitting there strumming the guitar it kind of clears my head. so i guess the guitar serves many different purposes for me. lets see. i am trying my hardest not to write about college. it is very hard since it has pretty much consumed my life for the last two or three months. it is mostly because ever since i started getting ready to move there has been so much stuff to do. i am really being distracted by the television that is on in my room. i have terrible study habits that i need to break as soon as possible before i get to far into college. i was able to breeze through high school without studying, but i know i won't be able to do that in college. of course sport center is on so it is very hard for my to resist. i know that i watch too much sports. i will really watch anything.

"everything we experience is filtered through our mind, and if that mind is contaminated by thoughts, preconceived notions, or the need to continuously categorize everything our experiences become tainted. later when we realize the error, the experience seems somewhat lost because what it was abased on is no longer true. thinking about past experiences blinds you to the present especially when trying to compare the two. the past cannot be altered by the realization of a mistake, but it can't be relived at the same time. to move along, trusting nothing and everything, simultaneously and exclusively, through each experience, is to forgo all attachment, all security, all dependence, all crutches. the things that you continue, to do out of routine, out of habit is not something done for love. love can exist without any sort of routine if all attachment is dissolved. evolution involves change, change can catch you offguard but it is inevitable. to be strong is to change, to adapt to each situation and expect nothing. unmet expectations, grasping to the future, grasping to the past &#8211;all are causes of suffering, anxiety, and tension. to evolve is to transcend the suffering anxiety and tension and necessitates eliminating the causes of pain that reside in your own mind. people can inflict pain and suffering only if you let them, if your mind is contaminated by constructs. objectifying experience removes the suffering but also removes the joy. to cleanse your mind is not the same as objectifying everything around you. to evolve is to transcend the suffering and still experience. everything everywhere is constantly changing so if you hold on to it, its going to drag you around, but if you let go the current will carry you. kerbey lane looks really busy but we have no coffee so to flow with the current is to move through the lane of least resistance which only you know because the current is in your mind, it is your mind. the line between love and attachment is often confused and blurred because there is no line. you draw the line and you choose where to stand, but you can't be afraid to run around cross the line erase the line but you must choose. even walking the line is a choice, you cannot deny that.

"i really don't know how to use the internet and i have a feeling everyone can tell how ignorant i am. i really wish that i did not have to use the computer for my class assignments, its not like i will really have to use it in medicine. i wish my dad would subscribe t o the internet at home. oh well at least during the christmas vacation i probably get a car if my grades are doing real well. i wish my dad had not held me to that deal, i mean what if i flunk out of math, my dad will kill me. forget the car i just my hope my dad is in a very happy mood during the christmas holiday just incase i fail. you know i am really scared what if i really do something to endanger me in to getting to the medical school of my choice, what if do get  into medical school and i happen to fail, what if i became a doctor and all my patients died on me will i be labeled as a bad doctor and have to forfeit my license. i really have to talk to the microbiology advisor so i can see what courses i should be taking and when i can fit them in so i can graduate in four years. you know what this is a stupid assignment because i am still thinking about spelling everything correctly and capitalizing, this even reminds of my psychology class in high school. mr. ward was cool but his class was very boring, he should have known that because everybody was falling asleep and hardly anyone did well on his tests. you know if i had been a braver soul i would have blatantly told him his class was too hard and too boring it didn't even help some of my friends who to the a. p. exam. what kind of teacher is that who can't make sure all his students pass a standardized test he has seen before. that bring me to mrs. whitenight i cant believe i didn't do that well on the a. p. exam, i suffered through out the whole year in her class only to not be able to receive a four or five. i mean really since i suffered and improved each and every day in her class i should have gotten a five, but oh now you know what i could believe that since she was a member grading the exams that she helped get that low of a score it sounds really silly, but who cares i don't have to look at her ugly face again thank goodness. and you know mrs. dubner should not try to cover up that she has thinning hair i mean thousands of women each year go through the same thing, if she really wanted her hair to grow she should have tried rogaine or something to that effect. this is almost over thank you god i never want to do this again but i have to. yesterday my birthday was half good and half bad i cant believe my family could not have fed exed me a package ,it a good thing i have friends like jean and rosemary. i still haven't talked to dina and i could  not believe she chose my major after saying she would not like it, it would have been great had she told me the truth instead of me having to hear it from regina the nerve of her trying to steal my major. i mean its not like it belongs to me anyway, but it seems like she going around my back trying to one up like so if we go back to richardson she can tell every body how much better she is at microbiology than i am. i can tell you one thing she will never get that satisfaction i am going to work harder and work better then she will the only class she can probably beat me in is computer science and i can get me a tutor so i can improve my grades in that , thank you very much. i hope i beat enough so that i graduate suma cum laude(knock on wood) and she graduates cum laude or magna cum laude ( i could care less). rosemary is a cool roommate , i sort of getting a little tired of jean i mean she complains from one thing to the next but she is a great friend i hope we all graduate together and become even better friends. today i am supposed to start jogging i hope i can make it around the track once with out collapsing, that would be a miracle in and of itself i think. i know i have to call my parents i am especially worried about my mom i mean ever since the death of princess diana she has sounded a lot weaker on the phone i hope she gets over it soon. i hope when i am able to get home for a holiday they will have my birthday presents, i can't believe jean and rosemary got me a perfume oil for my birthday that has to be the greatest birthday gift i have received from anyone since i got my cowboys' jacket from my parents on my fifteenth birthday ( in fact that  was the last birthday i got present from my parents at all. you know in the two weeks i have been here i have forgotten all about mike almer its a good thing too because i think i was starting to get obsessed about the whole thing. maybe i'll see him during the christmas holiday maybe i wont maybe i'll even have another boyfriend who'll treat me better any way i shouldn't be thinking about that right now i'll think about it later when i am about to graduate from medical school. well thank goodness my time is up its a good thing my professor won't really read this its not embarrassing i just don't feel like having anyone analyzing my brain waves or my mind thinking pattern, i would rather be analyzing someone else myself. i wonder what the projects are going to like i hope its going to great well i have to go so i can eat lunch which i have never wanted more than right now.

"well, it's becoming quite obvious to me now that the homework is beginning to pile on, but i'm perfectly okay with that because of all the stuff i went through last year in school. i did one of these for my psy class in high school and i remember some of the stuff i wrote about was quite funny, but hey, it's a stream of conscience. i actually love doing these kinds of things because for the majority of the time, the way we think is a stream, and it's never-ending. i really want to play tennis sometime soon, but today i just don't have the energy. i wonder when i'm going to get physically ill from staying up so late every night, and changing my habits a great deal. i'm getting quite used to the college way of life now. it's rather scary that i'm becoming more and more comfortable with calling my jester dorm """"home"""". i definitely miss my bed in my real home. i wonder what else i have to do tonight. i love having all the assignments, tests, papers, quizzes, etc. ahead of time so i can plan ahead and not be able to  blame my teacher if i forget something. this is really good for typing practice. i love my schedule, yeah tomorrow's a terrible day for classes, but aren't all mondays terrible. i can't believe my hand is cramping up already. that has got to be a bad sign. sometimes i really am not sure if i'd want people to know my stream of conscience. at times it can make people sound very stupid, like now. i'm very excited i received a call from jeff tonight, he's such a great friend and i haven't seen him or talked to him since i left albuquerque. that's a terrible word to spell, but hey, living there my whole life i should be able to do it in my sleep. oh, sleep, that sounds like a great idea. i am way too tired to do anything, but that's when i need to force myself, and just get into a studying groove. i'm really not looking forward to the noisy people that will be hanging out below my window tonight, playing guitar, singing, talking loudly, until early hours of the morning. then i'll have to call down to the jester  desk again and complain. they must hate me by now. i wonder when i follow up for the psy experiments. my roommate has way too much stuff around her desk, but she lets me use her computer, so it's a fair trade. i love typing, although crazy as it may sound, i do. i am just itching all over. i want to go outside, but i really don't feel like leaving the comfort of my room and face the people of jester. i am terribly blind with out my glasses or contacts. i really need to call in my contact prescription tomorrow, so i can actually see. i feel that i've been more tired lately because i haven't had my contacts, and i'm self conscious about my glasses, so it's quite a strain on my eyes, and as a result, i am more tired. i just lost complete track of my thoughts. oh well, must start on a new track, i mean isn't that the purpose of the exercise. speaking of exercise, i really want to get out and run a few laps, i know that it would help in being so tired. i'm tired of the jester food, i've been living off of bagels, not from jester. my roommate just came in and told me something that changed my thought pattern and now i'm concerned with the issue of how guys talk about girls, and how they treat girls. the whole issue is a problem of some sort in everyone's life, i just wish i didn't have to deal with it. i am quite addicted to diet cokes and diet drinks in all, i think i have a serious problem, yet i live for it. i feel like one right now. boy do i need to do laundry. it just keeps piling up, of course the one day i finally decide to do it, everyone else has the same idea. i can't wait to go through the dorm experience, and then move on into an apartment and have things of my own. i wonder if i will have an apartment next year, and i wonder who would be my roomie(s) then, if any.

"well, i have procrastinated on doing this assignment for long enough, and so i guess i should start working on it now. it's a thursday afternoon and all i'm doing is staying at the apartment to do this assignment. what a life! these stupid pop-ups keep on coming up, it's interrupting my thinking process. let's see, i've been up here for about a month now, and i have yet been able to see and fun"""" that everyone that went here or is going here claim. it's not that i want to be partying everyday, still i would like to see what's all the fuss's about. then again, my life here at the apartment is great. i live with two roommates, each have their own eccentricity, still without them i would be bored out of my mind. these restaurants around here keep on posting flyers in front of my door- it's getting really annoying. i'm hungry, yet i don't want to go grab something to eat - does that make me lazy? of course not! it's because i have to sit here for 20 minutes to write this assignment, yea that's it. during the day this place is so quiet, almost everyone that's living here goes to ut, so during the day they're at the campus. maybe i should spend more time at the campus. maybe that would help me get to know more people. i haven't made one single friend yet, well besides those people that i see in class everyday, those that i greet with a casual hello; however, i don't think of them as friends, just acquaintances. my computer desk keeps on shaking while i'm typing this, i should have brought a sturdier desk, but then how would it fit in here? this place is so cramped. luckily, this weekend i'm going back home to houston to get a bunk bed, and also to see my family and girlfriend of course. i miss my family very much, especially my dad. he have always been the strict yet caring figure that shadows every minute of my life up till now. now, i have to be on my own, that's the only way that i will learn to grow up. i know he must be worried out of his mind right now, wondering what i'm doing up here, wondering how my health is, wondering how i'm doing in school, wondering how late i sleep, wondering how many times i eat in a day, etc. i know he worries, but the best i can do is call him every night just to let him know that i'm doing fine. i can't go back home, if i live with him, then he will take care of everything for me, then i will never learn to grow up. i miss my mom too, but i'm more attached to my dad because he is the only other male in our family of seven. the buses hear run pretty frequently, i just heard another bus pass by our apartment, this is pretty convenient. my roommate just got home, he is the bossy but cool one out of us. i'm like the normal one, well, besides my random outburst of course. my other roommate is the cool, quiet subtle one. it's always fun to pick on him, but we know our limits. oh yea, vsa meeting is today, maybe i will get to know more people. then again, i doubt it because i'm always quiet and reserved so i guess i won't talk much. well, i'm going to wrap this up because the timer's about to run out. after this, i'm going to head to class, then it's vsa meeting.

"i'm also, i just got interrupted by a friend of mine i always seem to run into someone when i'm in the computer lab she's in my spanish class which is nice because she always makes me laugh i wish i could type i can't so this assignment is going very slowly for me anyway back to my friend she and i used to live together my freshmen year then over the summer we both went to the same language school in mexico only i didn't know she was going to be there and vice versa we saw each other in the court yard of the school one day by chance it was pretty weird to go all the way to another country just to run into your housemate i'm pretty tired and these 20 minutes aren't going by very fast i need to get home so i can watch road rules but i don't know where to catch my bus which is a little comical considering that my 20 years old i should know how to use public transportation i don't though because i usually drive but the parking situation is so bad i would have to wake up at the crack of dawn to find a parking place even then it would probably take an act of god oh well i don't have to worry about that today i only need worry about finding my bus i think it's in front of jester i have a lot of classes in jester this semester which i don't like i hate that place it reminders me of my freshmen year not that i lived there it's just that it's such a freshmen place and it smells bad like a day care center ok i would like to apologize for that low blow i was a freshmen too once speaking of freshmen why given the parking problem are they allowed to have cars on campus that pisses me off ",0
"well, i don't exactly know why i'm doing this, but i do enjoy the idea of trying to figure out what's in this head of mine. sharon's checking her email, but she will be leaving soon to go get a bagel. i'm not that hungry because i had a huge breakfast. there are a lot of people in this library. i wish i had internet connection at home because it would be so convenient. i wonder what my parents are doing right now. i wonder if their business is doing well. i wonder when they will be able to retire. i wonder when god will essentially allow them to stop working. god works in mysterious ways, and that's what makes him god i suppose. i'm really glad i got to talk to paul last night online. he is a nice guy. i got to talk to carol too, but really didn't have much to say, which is not surprising. there's a lot of interesting different people here at ut. such a contrast from plano west, where everyone wants to be popular and only buys the best things in life. but are the things they think are the best really the best? don't think so. i miss home, but i really do enjoy it here at austin. i haven't been homesick at all, which might be a good thing or a bad thing. i feel like i abuse my parents so much, verbally. i don't ever take into consideration the fact that they have feelings too. i just say whatever to them and never think clearly. in a sense it is good to be comfortable with people, but being completely immune to their well-being is not good at all. why am i such a malicious person? i think sometimes being malicious on purpose might be better than being malicious without even thinking, because then that means that being malicious has become second nature. i really need to work out more often. i've gotten so freaking lazy, and as a result, fatter, or ?healthy? as my parents call it. why am i so frugal, actually it shouldn't even be considered frugality because it's to the point of stinginess, like scrooge. i don't get it. i try to not think about how much money i spend, but i get so greedy and selfish. i seriously think that if food wasn't so essential to life i would probably not eat and horde money all day. why god? actually i shouldn't be questioning you. i'm sorry. it's my fault. i am just an evil person. that's it. we are all just naturally evil. well, that sounds too hobbes-like. we do have good in us, but we are all sinners no doubt. but i seem like my sins all go unnoticed because i do them so often and i don't realize it anymore. i've got 10 minutes left on this. shar's going to the restroom. i have so much reading to do. and sometimes i feel like i read and read and read and study, but then when i get to class i feel like i did nothing at all. wow, 10 minutes is a pretty long time. not when watching television or a movie. i guess time does fly when you're having fun. i wonder who thought that one up. i haven't seen a movie in the theater in awhile. i wish there was a dollar theater close by. i wish i could get a job. i wish i could manage my time better. i should really take into account opportunity costs of everything i do or buy. sometimes i wish i was more economically conscious but then i feel like sometimes i'm too economically conscious. i do too many things for my own good. i never think about other people. instead, i think how much of my own money, energy, etc. is going into making someone else happy. that's so wrong. man, i have psych in about an hour. i wonder what we will talk about. i wonder if i read enough. i wonder how my first quiz in college will be like tomorrow. i really need to stop eating so much and work out more. i cannot possibly rationalize all my eating by my walking to and from school everyday. 5 more minutes. i wonder what god thinks of me. maybe i shouldn't wonder. what else is there to say? i feel like my brain has been racked and pried. is that how you spell the past tense of pry? i have so much reading to do. did i mention that? by the time i get home, i will probably be so tired. but i need to read. shar's going to her echo meeting so i will be home alone with no internet access. man i am so spoiled. as early as 1-2 years ago i didn't depend so highly on technology. but look at me now. well, i guess we should look at ourselves now. what to say? i wonder what my parents think of me. i think too much about what other people think of me. i need to stop and think about what i think about myself. i thought that girl looked familiar. hmm. i'm almost done dude. almost done. only 1 minute left. i have written a lot. well at least i feel like it. now that i'm almost done i feel like the 20 minutes went by really fast. so i guess this was both enriching and entertaining to see what's in my brain. 10 seconds. done!

"ready, set, go. wow, my grammar has gotten pretty bad. i wonder if this thing has, i hate these stupid pop ups, spell check. i just woke up, feel pretty worthless. saw pink floyd played to the wizard of oz last night pretty cool probably cooler if i was stoned. only been stoned once before, didn't like it, no desire to do it again. i'm a beer girl. need to work out, clothes don't fit as well as they use to. josh won't like that. i'm glad laura is coming this weekend i hope she has fun. i really miss my family, i hope my sister can can, fuck these pop ups, come up next weekend for austin city limits. i don't know where anyone went, they're probably eating lunch. damn, 11 more minutes, i don't really know what else to write about, maybe or is maybe if i turn on some music. this is one of my favorite songs, i like it better than the original, i think it was remade for good will hunting, it makes me feel so. i don't know, introspective. bad word, but can't think of anything else. i love words, probably the only reason i did well on the sat. damn i'm still so tired, don't know why, must have slept for at least twelve hours. i think i might be getting sick. spring break best vacation of my whole life, some of my favorite memories. memories are an odd thing. i wonder why you remember the things you do. walked into the geo building the other day and the smell of it-deja vu-it was such an odd feeling, and i can't quite pin point what it reminded me of. i wish i knew. deja vu is such a weird thing i knew more about it- what triggers it and everything, maybe some day.
